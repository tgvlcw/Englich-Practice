My answer 1:
I agree students should be allowed to study what they want to learn and what interests them. Those courses they are interested in can motivate and encourage them to gain more knowledge and comprehend it deeper. If they gain what they are eager to learn, it will convert into interest to be the foundation for their successful future.

I do not hold on to the idea that schools should permit students to attain common knowledge and practical skills from the courses they long to study. School is the place to direct students on what they should or should not learn, what learning is or is not essential, and how to learn at their current age.


Example 1:

I agree that high school students should be able to choose their courses without any limitations. Students will pay more attention to their classes if they are learning what they want to know.

It is evident that students should not be allowed to take only the courses that they want to study. If they are given such options, they will take only easy courses and avoid possibly boring but important course.


My answer 2:
I firmly believe that various ways of wearing affect people’s behavior from different aspects. Diverse clothes of colors, styles, and textiles not only represent one’s personality and current emotion but also imply which ways of action they will express to others. The more colorful and brighter clothes a person wears, the more lively and optimistic personality a person is.

I do not hold on to the idea that different clothing styles do not determine one’s behavior. There are two reasons for this. First, how people conduct has nothing to do with how people dress. Also, which way of people’s behavior would display relies on their intrinsic nature but not their clothing styles.

Example 2:
I firmly believe that clothes change people's behavior. Students try not to get into trouble when they are wearing their school uniforms because they can be easily identified by their uniforms.

There is no question that human behavior has nothing to do with one's clothes. If we could change people's behavior with clothes, we would be able to reform criminals by changing their clothes.


My answer 3:
I firmly believe that the focus of present mass media is attracted more by the private life of celebrities and some public figures. It is easy to make the public ignore some significant current events if television, newspaper, and mass media take only notice of famous person’s personal lives.

I do not hold on to the idea that the personal lives of celebrities and public figures have been sufficiently exposed to the public by media organizations. They should reveal more about celebrities’ personal lives and individual behavior, which may be illegal or have negative effects on society so that these kinds of activities can be supervised by the public.


Example 3:
I am in favor of the idea that the mass media tend to dig excessively into the personal lives of famous people. I believe that we do not have to know what they do in their free time unless they commit crimes or harm one’s life.

In my view, it is unavoidable for public figures and celebrities to be exposed to the mass media. The media would not be interested in the private lives of those people if they were not famous.


My answer 4:
I support the idea that our world has become a more comfortable and convenient place to reside because of technological development. At present, computer and communication technological advancements can make people talk with their family and friends at a remote distance without face-to-face seeing required.

I am against the idea that technological development has made people live either easier or happier, and it has also made our mother earth become a better place. On the contrary, as technology develops rapidly, the life rhythm of modern humans has become so quickly that they do not have enough free time to relax. Moreover, our environment is facing severe problems.


Example 4:
I firmly believe that technology has made our lives more convenient. As a result of technology developments, we can even buy clothes on the Internet.

I am against the opinion that we have made the world a better place to live because of technology. In my experience, technology has only made our lives busier and more complex.


My answer 5:
I support the idea that taking part in a performance, concert and some other activities in person is more pleasurable than only watching it on television. It is well-known that people engaging in a live performance can enjoy a feast of visual and sound effects better than merely viewing it on television or the Internet.

I do not hold on to the opinion that it is more enjoyable to participate in a live performance than to watch it on TV. Because attending a live performance means you are obliged to cost much more money and spend more time preparing and planning it, such as booking a ticket in advance and rearranging your schedule.


AI Modified:
I agree that seeing a performance, concert, or other activity in person rather than just viewing it on television is more enjoyable. It is a well-known fact that attending a live performance allows one to experience a greater variety of visual and aural impacts than simply watching it on television or the internet.

I do not cling to the notion that attending a live performance is preferable to watching it on television. Because going to a live event requires you to spend more time and money planning, including purchasing a ticket in advance and altering your calendar.

My answer 6:
I support the idea that studying history and literature is more worthwhile for students than studying science and mathematics. The reason is that students studying history are not only able to gain valuable experiences from our ancestors' accomplishments, but they can also cultivate their sentiments through literature to become future socially useful individuals.

I do not hold on to the idea that learning science and mathematics is not as essential as learning history and literature. The developments of our modern society mostly rely on scientific and mathematical accomplishments that human beings have gained over the past 100 years, and they will also be over the next 100 years. Therefore, students should pay more attention and spend more time on science and mathematics.


AI Modified:
I concur that pupils would benefit more from studying history and literature than science and math. Studying history allows students to gain valuable experience from our ancestors' accomplishments as well as cultivate their sentiments through literature to improve their social skills.

I reject the notion that studying history and literature is more important than math and science. In the past 100 years, human beings have gained many scientific and mathematical accomplishments that are essential to the development of our modern society, and they will remain so for the next 100 years as well. Students should therefore pay greater attention and devote more time to studying science and maths.




My answer 7:
I support the idea that people playing a game can feel pleasure and delight by winning the game. The most exciting and cheerful moment for athletes at the Olympic Games is when they conquer other competitors and win the game.

I do not believe losing a game means you cannot have fun and be happy. Suppose a track and field athlete lost a game in a match and merely gained second place. He could also feel fun and pleasure because he broke the best records in his whole sports career.


AI Modified:
I believe that winning a game can bring joy and satisfaction to those who are participating in it. Athletes' most thrilling and joyful moments at the Olympics are when they defeat opponents and win the match.

I do not think that losing a game prevents you from having fun and being happy. Consider a track and field athlete who finished second despite dropping a game in a competition. Because he set the best records of his entire sporting career, he was also able to experience delight and pleasure.

My answer 8:
I support the idea that borrowing money from a friend is not beneficial to maintaining a good friendship. In my experience, if a person borrows money frequently from friends and never thinks of paying the money back on time, nobody will want to make a friend with him again and keep a friendship with him.

I do not hold on to the idea that a friendship can be harmed or damaged by borrowing money from friends. For example, suppose a person whose mother or father suffers from a severe disease borrows money from his friends. In that case, I believe he will remember his friends' kindness forever and do the same thing to assist his friends if they experience a financial crisis in the future.


AI Modified:
I believe that borrowing money from a friend is not beneficial to maintaining a relationship. In my experience, no one will want to create or maintain a friendship with someone who constantly borrows money from friends and never considers paying the money back on time.

I do not believe that asking for financial assistance from friends may hurt or ruin a friendship. Assume, for instance, that someone asks his friends for financial assistance since their parent(s) has a terrible illness. In that event, I think he will never forget the generosity of his friends and will take the same action to help them in the future if they run into financial difficulties.

My answer 9:
Taking a solo trip would give me more freedom to make decisions by myself. Even so, I still wish to travel with my friends for safety reasons. From television and the Internet, I often hear the news that some people who travel alone are missing, injured, or even dead. Therefore, safety is the only and most significant consideration among all aspects.

Between traveling alone and traveling with a companion, I would prefer to travel alone for two reasons. First, I can decide where to go, what to eat, and how long to tour without taking into account others' opinions. In addition, it is easier for me to make new friends, pay more attention to gorgeous scenes and landscapes along the journey, and develop my independence simultaneously.


AI Modified:
I would have greater freedom to make my own judgments if I traveled alone. I still want to go on the trip with my friends, though, for safety reasons. I frequently learn about missing, hurt, or even deceased solo travelers through the media and the Internet. As a result, safety is the sole and most important factor to take into account.

I would choose to travel alone over traveling with a companion for two reasons. I can choose where to go, what to eat, and how long to travel without considering what other people think. Additionally, it is beneficial for me to grow my independence, make new friends, and pay more attention to the breathtaking scenery and landscapes along the way.

My answer 10:
Between doing what I already do well and doing something new, I prefer to do what I do well. Because doing these kinds of things can make fewer mistakes and decrease the failure probabilities of what I am currently doing or what I plan to conduct. For example, my smartphone was released by the Xiaomi corporation, which usually reminds me to upgrade the cell phone system. Even so, I always avoid upgrading my cell phone systems since this will result in a greater risk that may cause a system crash, reduced battery life, or other issues if I approve.

It is well-known that a majority of people's life expectancies are less than 100 years. It implies that life is an adventure in which you are sometimes obliged to take risks and try new things, and a journey in which you can enjoy the gorgeous scenes and make new friends along the way. In other words, if you do not try to do something challenging and unfamiliar or break out of your comfort zone, you seem to have never existed in this world besides possessing one frail and sickly body that will decompose soon after you die. And you are similar to a zombie with no soul, no mind, and no emotion. This world is meaningless to you.


AI Modified:
When given a choice between doing what I already do well and trying something new, I choose the former. Because performing these things can help me make fewer mistakes and reduce the likelihood that what I'm doing now or what I have planned will fail. For instance, the Xiaomi company, which produced my smartphone, typically reminds me to upgrade the phone's operating system. Even so, I never upgrade the systems on my cell phones because doing so increases the possibility of a system crash, a reduction in battery life, or other problems if I give the go-ahead.

The majority of people's life expectancies are fewer than 100 years, which is a well-known fact. It symbolizes that life is an adventure where you occasionally have to take chances and attempt new things, as well as a journey where you can take in the beautiful scenery and meet new people along the route. To put it another way, if you don't strive to accomplish anything difficult and unknown or step outside of your comfort zone, you will appear to have never existed in this world and will only have a weak, diseased body that will deteriorate shortly after your death. In a way, you are like a zombie without a soul, thought, or feeling. You are pointless in this world.

My answer 11:
Although people obtaining knowledge from teachers who are professionals in a specific field can save their study time, I still believe learning by myself is a better method for me because not only can I regulate the pace of studying, but it is beneficial to develop my independence and self-control ability when I learn by myself. There is a saying, "the master leads you to the door, the rest is up to you."

Teachers can sometimes assist us in how to find the most appropriate solution to a challenging issue and guide us on what content we should focus on or what not to focus on in textbooks. Moreover, more and more parents enroll their children in extracurricular classes during the holidays. Thus, learning from teachers is more helpful than learning by yourself.


AI Modified:
Although learning from teachers who are experts in a certain field can help students cut down on study time, I still think learning independently is a superior strategy for me since independent learning helps me strengthen my independence and self-control. "The master guides you to the door; the rest is up to you," is a proverb.

Teachers can occasionally offer advice on how to approach difficult problems and can direct us as to which textbook topics to emphasize or ignore. Additionally, more parents are enrolling their kids in extracurricular tuition classes over the holidays. Learning from teachers is, therefore, more beneficial than learning on your own.

My answer 12:
It is reported that approximately 8 billion people live on earth today, but more than half of them suffer from starvation, diseases, inadequate housing, etcetera. Instead of investing a large amount of money in exploring outer space and exoplanets, the government should provide more capital and subsidies to deal with poverty and basic needs issues. 

As more revenues are invested in the space industry, we can already launch rockets and spacecraft to other planets and even land humans on the moon. As a result, without the support of NASA during SpaceX's start-up stage, I doubt that SpaceX would still exist today, and be able to execute its grand plan to launch more than 1000 manned Starships onto Mars next 50 years.


AI Modified:
According to estimates, there are currently 8 billion people on the planet, yet more than half of them are afflicted by hunger, diseases, insufficient shelter, etc. Thus, the government should allocate more funding and subsidies to address issues of poverty and fundamental needs rather than spending a significant amount on exploring space and exoplanets.

As more money is invested in the space business, we have already launched rockets and spacecraft to other planets and landed people on the moon. Therefore, I doubt that SpaceX would still be around today and be able to carry out its ambitious plan to launch more than 1000 manned Starships towards Mars over the next 50 years without NASA's assistance during SpaceX's start-up phase.

In terms of working by hand versus using a machine, I prefer to work by hand because I can feel more satisfaction when I do things by hand. In my opinion, products made by hand are more memorable and valuable than those created by machines. Working by hand can better reflect human beings' intelligence and traditional culture than using machines.

It is evident that cooperating with machines can help produce stuff more effectively and efficiently. I can envision that the first Industrial Revolution would not emerge without the steam engine widely popularized two hundred years before. Thus, human society might still be stuck in the agricultural society where people had to make their living by hand.

The price of items made by hand is often higher than those made by machine. In other words, the more expensive a product is, the higher its collection value will be. For example, many museums are exceedingly eager to collect the authentic Mona Lisa's portrait because it was created by Leonardo da Vinci hundreds of years ago. However, nobody wishes to collect a counterfeit one manufactured by factory assembly lines.

Items produced by machines are usually cheaper than those made by hand, so they are affordable for most people, even the poor. Additionally, a machine-made product is easier to repair than a hand-crafted one, or we can simply discard the old one and purchase a new one if it cannot be repaired.

My answer 15:
In my experience, living in a traditional house or a cottage is preferable to living in a modern apartment. The former means I may possess a garden where I can plant various flowers and vegetables in different seasons; a backyard where I can enjoy the sunshine and breathe the fresh air in the morning; and even a swimming pool where I can dive in the summer. Moreover, living in a house is more effortless to maintain relationships with neighbors.

In consideration of safety issues, I would rather dwell in a modern apartment instead of residing in a cottage since I can feel more sense of security, especially in the evening. Living in an apartment makes me not only enjoy the gorgeous scenery of the whole city and the light show at night, but also access to other places like the hospital and the supermarket would be more convenient.


AI Modified:
My personal opinion is that a traditional home or a cottage is preferable to a contemporary flat. The former suggests that I might have a garden where I can grow different flowers and vegetables throughout the year, a backyard where I can bask in the morning sun and breathe in the fresh air, and perhaps a swimming pool where I can go diving in the summer. Additionally, it is easier to establish friendships with neighbors when you live in a house.

When it comes to safety, I would choose to live in a modern apartment over a cottage since I can feel more secure there, especially at night.

If you do not listen to others' advice or learn from their experiences, you probably get into trouble in life or at work. Moreover, the suggestions of family or friends would, in large measure, assist you in solving your current hardship or perplexity more effortlessly. As modern technology develops more sophisticated and abstract, it is evident that a person might still study at school when he or she is 50 years old without predecessors' counsel and experience.


In my opinion, learning about life through seeing with one's eyes and personal experience would make people digest these experiences more quickly and effectively. In other words, some valuable experiences can be utilized in other similar circumstances if we internalize them. Therefore, only by learning from individual experience can new technology and knowledge emerge in the near future.

Moreover, the Internet has some significant influences on other technological fields. It is imaginable that exploring outer space, autonomous driving technology, and some scientific research will not develop further without the Internet.


Although the emergence of the Internet has brought great conveniences to people in both life and work, much harmful and unhealthy information is hidden in the corner of the Internet. Suppose parents do not scrutinize what their children watch and read on the Internet; their kids will probably be affected by pornography and violent videos, which have been confirmed not to be beneficial for teenagers' physical and mental health.
