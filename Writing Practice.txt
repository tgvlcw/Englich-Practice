My answer 1:
I agree students should be allowed to study what they want to learn and what interests them. Those courses they are interested in can motivate and encourage them to gain more knowledge and comprehend it deeper. If they gain what they are eager to learn, it will convert into interest to be the foundation for their successful future.

I do not hold on to the idea that schools should permit students to attain common knowledge and practical skills from the courses they long to study. School is the place to direct students on what they should or should not learn, what learning is or is not essential, and how to learn at their current age.


Example 1:

I agree that high school students should be able to choose their courses without any limitations. Students will pay more attention to their classes if they are learning what they want to know.

It is evident that students should not be allowed to take only the courses that they want to study. If they are given such options, they will take only easy courses and avoid possibly boring but important course.


My answer 2:
I firmly believe that various ways of wearing affect people’s behavior from different aspects. Diverse clothes of colors, styles, and textiles not only represent one’s personality and current emotion but also imply which ways of action they will express to others. The more colorful and brighter clothes a person wears, the more lively and optimistic personality a person is.

I do not hold on to the idea that different clothing styles do not determine one’s behavior. There are two reasons for this. First, how people conduct has nothing to do with how people dress. Also, which way of people’s behavior would display relies on their intrinsic nature but not their clothing styles.

Example 2:
I firmly believe that clothes change people's behavior. Students try not to get into trouble when they are wearing their school uniforms because they can be easily identified by their uniforms.

There is no question that human behavior has nothing to do with one's clothes. If we could change people's behavior with clothes, we would be able to reform criminals by changing their clothes.


My answer 3:
I firmly believe that the focus of present mass media is attracted more by the private life of celebrities and some public figures. It is easy to make the public ignore some significant current events if television, newspaper, and mass media take only notice of famous person’s personal lives.

I do not hold on to the idea that the personal lives of celebrities and public figures have been sufficiently exposed to the public by media organizations. They should reveal more about celebrities’ personal lives and individual behavior, which may be illegal or have negative effects on society so that these kinds of activities can be supervised by the public.


Example 3:
I am in favor of the idea that the mass media tend to dig excessively into the personal lives of famous people. I believe that we do not have to know what they do in their free time unless they commit crimes or harm one’s life.

In my view, it is unavoidable for public figures and celebrities to be exposed to the mass media. The media would not be interested in the private lives of those people if they were not famous.


My answer 4:
I support the idea that our world has become a more comfortable and convenient place to reside because of technological development. At present, computer and communication technological advancements can make people talk with their family and friends at a remote distance without face-to-face seeing required.

I am against the idea that technological development has made people live either easier or happier, and it has also made our mother earth become a better place. On the contrary, as technology develops rapidly, the life rhythm of modern humans has become so quickly that they do not have enough free time to relax. Moreover, our environment is facing severe problems.


Example 4:
I firmly believe that technology has made our lives more convenient. As a result of technology developments, we can even buy clothes on the Internet.

I am against the opinion that we have made the world a better place to live because of technology. In my experience, technology has only made our lives busier and more complex.


My answer 5:
I support the idea that taking part in a performance, concert and some other activities in person is more pleasurable than only watching it on television. It is well-known that people engaged in a live performance can enjoy a feast of visual and sound effects better than merely viewing it on television or the Internet.

I do not hold on to the opinion that it is more enjoyable to participate in a live performance than to watch it on TV. Because attending a live performance means you are obliged to cost much more money and spend more time preparing and planning it, such as booking a ticket in advance and rearranging your schedule.

Example 5:
I support the idea that attending a live performance gives you more pleasure than watching it on TV. If there were no difference, people would not spend a lot of money to watch a performance with their own eyes.

I disagree that it is better to watch a performance with your own eyes than to watch it on TV. To support my opinion, I will present three advantages of watching a performance on TV.


My answer 6:
I support the idea that studying history and literature is more important for students than studying science and mathematics. That is because not only students who study history can learn valuable experiences from our ancestors' achievements, but they also cultivate their sentiments via learning literature to make them become socially useful people in the future.

I do not hold on to the idea that learning science and mathematics is not as essential as learning history and literature. The developments of our modern society mostly rely on scientific and mathematical accomplishments that human beings have gained over the past 100 years, and they will also be over the next 100 years. Therefore, students should pay more attention and spend more time on science and mathematics.


Example 6:
It is said that people are familiar with history and literature, and they can communicate very well with others. Therefore, I go along with the statement that history and literature are more important to study than science and mathematics.

I question whether we can measure the value of history, literature, science, and mathematics themselves. However, I firmly believe that science and mathematics are more useful for our daily lives than history and literature.


My answer 7:
I support the idea that people playing a game can feel pleasure and delight by winning the game. The most exciting and cheerful moment for athletes in the Olympic Games is when they conquer other competitors and win the game.

I do not believe losing a game means you can not feel fun and happy. If a track and field athlete lost a game in a match, although he merely gained second place, he could still feel fun and pleasure since he broke the best records in his whole sports career. 


Example 7:
I do not think you can enjoy a game when you are losing. Therefore, I agree that people have fun playing a game when they win.

In my opinion, The reason why people play a game with others is that they want to spend time with others without worrying about winning and losing. As a result, people can enjoy the game even when they lose.


My answer N:
Example N:


My answer 8:
I support the idea that borrowing money from a friend is not beneficial to maintain a good friendship. In my experience, if a person borrows money frequently from friends and never thinks of paying the money back on time, nobody will want to make a friend with him again and keep a friendship with him anymore.
I do not hold on to the idea that a friendship can be harmed or damaged by borrowing money from friends. For example, if a person whose mother or father is suffering from a severe disease borrows an amount of money from his friends, I believe he will remember his friends' kindness forever and do the same thing to assist his friends if they experience a financial crisis in the future.


Example 8:
People say that a friend in need is a friend indeed. For this reason, I do not think that friendship will be damaged if you borrow money from a friend of yours.

In my experience, it is always better not to borrow money from a friend. If you do not pay back the money on time, the friendship may be harmed.


My answer 9:
Traveling alone looks more freedom that I can make decisions by myself,  such as where to go and what to eat. Even so, I still wish to travel with my friends for safety reasons. I often hear news about some people who travel alone are missing, injured, or even death from the television and the Internet. So safety is the only and most crucial reason I must think of compared with other aspects.

Between traveling alone and traveling with a companion, I would prefer to travel alone for two reasons. First, I can decide where to go, what to eat, and how long to tour without considering others' opinions when I travel alone. In addition, it is easier for me to make new friends, pay more attention to gorgeous sceneries and landscapes along the journey, and develop my independence simultaneously.


Example 9:
People have different reasons for traveling. In my case, I like to travel in order to make good memories. But I believe the memories will be useless if there is no one to share them. Thus, I prefer traveling with a companion to traveling by myself.

If you travel with a companion, you will have to spend almost 24 hours a day with the person even if you do not want to. Because I would want some time to be alone when I travel, I would rather go traveling by myself than travel with a companion. 


My answer 10:
Between doing what I already do well and doing something new, I prefer to do what I did well. Because doing these kinds of things can make fewer mistakes and decrease the failure probabilities of what I am currently doing or what I plan to conduct. For example, my smartphone was released by Xiaomi corporation, which usually reminds me to upgrade the cell phone system. However, I always avoid upgrading my cell phone system since I will take higher risks which may cause a system crash, reduced battery life, and other exceptional issues if I approve it.

It is well-known that a majority of people's life expectancies are less than 100 years. It implies that life is an adventure in which you are sometimes obliged to take risks and try new things, and a  journey in which you can enjoy the gorgeous scenes and know many ones along the way. If you do not attempt to either do something challenging and unfamiliar or make new friends and break through your comfort zone, it seems that you will never exist in this world besides possessing one frail and sickly body which will decay once soon after you die. And you are similar to a zombie with no soul, no mind, and no emotion. This world is meaningless to you.


Example 10:
Even if you are an expert, you may not be as good as you used to be if you do not practice from time to time. Thus, in my opinion, it is better to do what I am good at over time than to try what I have never done before.

It is safer to do what I am good at than to do what I have not tried before. Nevertheless, I can not learn new things if I only do the activities I can already do. For this reason, I would choose to try a new thing if given the choice between what I do well and what I have never done yet.



My answer N:
Example N:



My answer 11:
Although people obtaining knowledge from teachers who are professionals in a specific field can save their study time, I still believe learning by myself is a better method for me because not only I can regulate the pace of studying, but it is beneficial to develop my independence and self-control ability when I learn by myself. There is a saying, "the teacher only leads you in class; the rest of the contents depend on the individual."

Teachers can sometimes assist us on how to find the best solution to a challenging issue and guide us on what content we should focus on or what not to focus on in textbooks. Moreover, more and more parents enroll in extracurricular tuition classes for their children during the holidays. Thus, learning from teachers is more helpful than learning by yourself.


Example 11:
If you are taught by a teacher, you may be able to save some time. Nonetheless, I have learned from my experiences that it is better to learn by myself because I can take as much time as I want to in order to understand what I have learned.

I prefer learning from a teacher to learning by myself. Teachers give us the best routes to obtain knowledge. Without such guidance, we cannot know if we are learning correctly.



My answer 12:
It is reported that approximately 8 billion people live on earth today, but more than half of them suffer from starvation, diseases, accommodation, etcetera. Instead of investing a large amount of money in exploring outer space and exoplanets, the government should supply more capitals and subsidies to deal with poverty and basic needs issues. 

With rapid technological development, we can launch rockets and spacecraft to other planets and even land humans on the Moon. If without the support of NASA during SpaceX's start-up stage, I cannot imagine whether SpaceX would still exist currently, and start to execute its great plan that launches more than 1000 manned Starships onto Mars next 50 years.


Example 12:
Even though it is essential to learn as much about outer space as we know about Earth, we should acknowledge that there are so many people in need on Earth. If we put the ongoing space projects on hold for one year, we could probably serve more than one million meals to hungry people.

Some people believe that humans can live on Earth for at least another thousand years, so exploring outer space is unnecessary. Even so, we cannot predict the future. So we should prepare for it; space exploring is one way to prepare for the future.




My answer 13:
In terms of working by hand versus using a machine, I prefer to work by hand because I can feel more satisfaction when I do things by hand. In my opinion, products made by hand are more memorable and valuable than those created by machines. Working by hand can better reflect human beings' intelligence and traditional culture than using machines.

It is evident that cooperating with machines can help produce stuff more effectively and efficiently. I can envision that the first Industrial Revolution would not emerge without the steam engine widely popularized two hundred years before. Thus, human society might still be stuck in the agricultural society where people had to make their living by hand.

My answer 14:
The price of items made by hand is often higher than those made by machine. In other words, the more expensive a product is, the higher its collection value will be. For example, many museums are exceedingly eager to collect the authentic Mona Lisa's portrait because it was created by Leonardo da Vinci hundreds of years ago. However, nobody wishes to collect a counterfeit one manufactured by factory assembly lines.

Items produced by machines are usually cheaper than those made by hand, so they are affordable for most people, even the poor. Additionally, a machine-made product is easier to repair than a hand-crafted one, or we can simply discard the old one and purchase a new one if it cannot be repaired.

Items manufactured by hand are frequently more expensive than those made by machines. In other words, the higher the price of a thing, the larger its collection value. For instance, because the original Mona Lisa's portrait was made by Leonardo da Vinci hundreds of years ago, many museums are incredibly keen to acquire it. A counterfeit one, however, made on assembly lines, is of no interest to anyone.

Since manufactured goods are typically less expensive than those crafted by hand, even the poorest individuals can afford them. Additionally, a machine-made product is easier to repair than a hand-crafted one, or we can simply discard the old one and purchase a new one if it cannot be repaired.

My answer 15:
In my experience, living in a traditional house or a cottage is preferable to living in a modern apartment. The former means I may possess a garden where I can plant various flowers and vegetables in different seasons; a backyard where I can enjoy the sunshine and breathe the fresh air in the morning; and even a swimming pool where I can dive in the summer. Moreover, living in a house is more effortless to maintain relationships with neighbors.

In consideration of safety issues, I would rather dwell in a modern apartment instead of residing in a cottage since I can feel more sense of security, especially in the evening. Living in an apartment makes me not only enjoy the gorgeous scenery of the whole city and the light show at night, but also access to other places like the hospital and the supermarket would be more convenient.


AI Modified:
My personal opinion is that a traditional home or a cottage is preferable to a contemporary flat. The former suggests that I might have a garden where I can grow different flowers and vegetables throughout the year, a backyard where I can bask in the morning sun and breathe in the fresh air, and perhaps a swimming pool where I can go diving in the summer. Additionally, it is easier to establish friendships with neighbors when you live in a house.

When it comes to safety, I would choose to live in a modern apartment over a cottage since I can feel more secure there, especially at night. I would enjoy living in an apartment not only for the views of the city as well as the light show at night, but also for the convenience of access to other places like the hospital and the supermarket.

My answer 16:
If you do not listen to others' advice or learn from their experiences, you probably get into trouble in life or at work. Moreover, the suggestions of family or friends would, in large measure, assist you in solving your current hardship or perplexity more effortlessly. As modern technology develops more sophisticated and abstract, it is evident that a person might still study at school when he or she is 50 years old without predecessors' counsel and experience.


In my opinion, learning about life through seeing with one's eyes and personal experience would make people digest these experiences more quickly and effectively. In other words, some valuable experiences can be utilized in other similar circumstances if we internalize them. Therefore, only by learning from individual experience can new technology and knowledge emerge in the near future.

AI Modified:
The likelihood is that you will get into trouble in your personal and professional life if you do not listen to other people's advice or learn from their experiences. Additionally, getting advice from relatives or friends would greatly help you resolve your current problem or conundrum more easily. It is evident that someone might continue to study in school at age 50 without the guidance and knowledge of predecessors as current technology becomes more sophisticated and abstract.

By learning about life by seeing with one's eyes and through personal experience, people would be able to absorb these experiences more quickly and efficiently. To put it another way, if we internalize some valuable experiences, we can apply them to other situations that are comparable to them. Therefore, the only way for new technology and knowledge to develop in the near future is by learning through personal experience.

My answer 17:
As computer technology rapidly develops these days, accessing the Internet is not a big deal for humans. Aside from basic functions like communication and listening to music, people can utilize the Internet to do a handful of meaningful things that emerged in recent years, such as watching live broadcasts, playing virtual reality games etcetera. Moreover, the Internet has some significant influences on other technological fields. It is imaginable that exploring outer space, autonomous driving technology, and some scientific research will not develop further without the Internet.


Although the emergence of the Internet has brought great conveniences to people in both life and work, much harmful and unhealthy information is hidden in the corner of the Internet. Suppose parents do not scrutinize what their children watch and read on the Internet; their kids will probably be affected by pornography and violent videos, which have been confirmed not to be beneficial for teenagers' physical and mental health.


AI Modified:
Accessing the Internet is not a big concern for humans these days because of how quickly computer technology is developing. People can use the Internet for a number of significant activities that have recently evolved, such as viewing live broadcasts, playing virtual reality games, etc., in addition to simple actions like communicating and listening to music. Additionally, there are also notable effects of the Internet on other technological sectors. Without the Internet, it is conceivable that technological advancements in driverless vehicles, science, and other fields will not occur.


Although the development of the Internet has provided people with many advantages in both their personal and professional lives, the Internet also contains a lot of unwholesome and hazardous information. If parents do not monitor what their kids read and view online, it is likely that their kids may be exposed to pornography and violent movies, which have been shown to be detrimental to the physical and mental health of teenagers.

In college, I would prefer to select a variety of disciplines rather than just one, as the former is better for expanding my horizons. Furthermore, the perception of boredom and tiredness that comes from concentrating on one subject can be somewhat countered by learning multiple things and being exposed to a range of knowledge. It is stated that taking multiple subjects in rotation rather than just one will increase your study productivity.


Choosing one subject over studying a variety of disciplines, in my opinion, is preferable since it gives me more time to concentrate on my mandatory subject and develop the professional abilities that will help me in my job. In addition, the more time and effort I invest in this subject, the better I comprehend and absorb it. According to the most recent job statistics, individuals who become proficient in a professional skill will have an advantage over those who merely have a cursory understanding of a variety of disciplines.
