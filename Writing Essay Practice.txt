1st essay

It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?

Children are too young to discern what should or should not be done in their daily lives, so it is crucial for parents how to guide children display correct patterns of behavior. I support the idea that the way of choosing punishments would assist children in developing positive codes of conduct, compared to do nothing if children make a mistake.
