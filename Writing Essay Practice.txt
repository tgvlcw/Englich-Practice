1st essay

It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?

As children are too young to discern what they should or should not do in their daily lives, how to guide children in displaying appropriate patterns of behavior is crucial for parents. I support the idea that the way of proper punishments, to large extent, would assist children in developing positive codes of conduct, compared to doing nothing if children make a mistake.   

The objective of punishment is to warn people about what they have done was wrong, and teach a lesson to prevent them from making same mistake again or even more serious one. As a result, parents as guardians must be responsible for their children's harmful behaviors, which parents sometimes have to compensate for the victims financially or are punished by law occasionally. This is a big trouble and unacceptable for an ordinary family. To avoid similiar events to occur, a majority of parents believe punishment is a effective method to educating their children, like slaping their children, forbiding children to eat, and reducing children's pocket money. Additionally, if children injury their peers or violate school rules at school, minor penalties, such as standing outside of classroom and sweeping classroom after school, should be carried out to make them memorize the things they done raise negtive influcences on class group and school. Therefore, a punished experience can be saved in their brains undeveloped so longer than unimpressive one that they can gradually form good behavior patterns over time.

However, whenever a serious punishment must prohibit because this is not be beneficial for children's physical and mental development. Meanwhile, the chances are that children will eventually develop incorrect habits or even commit a crime in the future if their parents are afraid of harming children and do nothing.

Overall, the way of choosing proper punishment is essential for correcting and cultivating children's concept of right and wrong. Nevertheless, grave punishment and being indifferent to children is inadvisable.
