1st essay

It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?

As children are too young to discern what they should or should not do in their daily lives, how to guide children in displaying appropriate patterns of behavior is crucial for parents. To a large extent, I agree with the idea that correct punishment would assist children in developing good codes of conduct rather than doing nothing if they make a mistake.  

It is well-known that the purpose of punishment is to warn people that what they did was wrong, and to teach them a lesson to prevent them from repeating the same mistake or making a more serious one in the future. As a result, parents as guardians are responsible for their children's harmful behaviors, which may mean compensating victims financially or facing legal punishment occasionally. This is a big trouble and unacceptable for a poor family. To avoid similar events from occurring, a majority of parents believe punishment is an effective method to educate their children, like slapping their children, forbidding children to eat, and reducing children's pocket money. In addition, if children injure their peers or violate school rules at school, minor penalties, such as standing outside the classroom and sweeping the classroom after school, should be applied to ensure that children are aware of the things they did producing negative effects on the class group and the school. Therefore, a period of punished experience can be stored in children's undeveloped brains longer than an unimpressive experience, so that they can gradually form good behavior patterns over time.

However, in any case, severe punishment should be prohibited because this is not beneficial for children's physical and mental development. Meanwhile, the chances are that children will eventually develop incorrect habits or even commit crimes in the future if their parents do nothing for fear of harming their children.

Overall, choosing proper punishment to discipline children is essential for correcting and cultivating their concept of right and wrong. In the meantime, the practice of grave punishment and indifference to children is inadvisable.
 


2nd essay

Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Other believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. 

Discuss both these views and give your opinion.

University is the place where students can acquire knowledge and expand their horizons, and learning interesting subjects may inspire their creativity. We will discuss here whether students should spend more time and effort on what subjects they prefer. 

On the one hand, learning an obscure subject is mainly based on interest and curiosity, and no one can completely concentrate on one thing without any distraction. As a result, choosing several subjects of interest in college can, to a large extent, counter the feeling of boredom and tiredness arising from a variety of required coursework. Furthermore, it is beneficial for students to develop their creative ability by allowing them to study what subjects they want to learn. It is imaginable that the law of gravitation would never be discovered if Newton either was not interested in or did not exhibit curiosity about why apples fall from trees to the ground. The decision to choose subjects at university according to one's heart is therefore justified.

Conversely, those students born into poor families are required to select science-related or technology-related subjects that appear to be more competitive in job statistics. It means that their family's burden can be significantly reduced once they are employed. Moreover, the higher rate of employment can improve the reputation of the university, which in turn would assist it in attracting more talented students to apply. This is also profitable for developing countries to cultivate more useful talents and enhance their synthetic power and international competitiveness. Therefore, requiring students to learn practical subjects is not only for students' economic prospects but also for the country's future.

Overall, it seems that, while requiring students to study certain disciplines is important for the nation's development, the lack of independence is a substantial drawback. Respecting students' options and allowing them to learn what they like would greatly increase their subjective initiative.
