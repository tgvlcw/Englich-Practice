1st essay

It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?

As children are too young to discern what they should or should not do in their daily lives, how to guide children in displaying appropriate patterns of behavior is crucial for parents. I support the idea that the way of proper punishments, to large extents, would assist children in developing positive codes of conduct, compared to doing nothing if children make a mistake.
