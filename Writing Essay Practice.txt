1st essay

It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?

As children are too young to discern what they should or should not do in their daily lives, how to guide children in displaying appropriate patterns of behavior is crucial for parents. To a large extent, I agree with the idea that correct punishment would assist children in developing good codes of conduct rather than doing nothing if they make a mistake.  

It is well-known that the purpose of punishment is to warn people that what they did was wrong, and to teach them a lesson to prevent them from repeating the same mistake or making a more serious one in the future. As a result, parents as guardians are responsible for their children's harmful behaviors, which may mean compensating victims financially or facing legal punishment occasionally. This is big trouble and unacceptable for a poor family. To avoid similar events from occurring, a majority of parents believe punishment is an effective method to educate their children, like slapping their children, forbidding children to eat, and reducing children's pocket money. In addition, if children injure their peers or violate school rules at school, minor penalties, such as standing outside the classroom and sweeping the classroom after school, should be applied to ensure that children are aware of the things they did producing negative effects on the class group and the school. Therefore, a period of punished experience can be stored in children's undeveloped brains longer than an unimpressive experience, so that they can gradually form good behavior patterns over time.

However, in any case, severe punishment should be prohibited because this is not beneficial for children's physical and mental development. Meanwhile, the chances are that children will eventually develop incorrect habits or even commit crimes in the future if their parents are afraid of harming children and doing nothing.

Overall, choosing proper punishment to discipline children is essential for correcting and cultivating their concept of right and wrong. In the meantime, the practice of grave punishment and indifference to children is inadvisable.
