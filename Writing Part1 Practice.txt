The two pie charts show the energy use in every Australian household and the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption.

The vast majority of energy was consumed for heating and water heating in each Australian household. Heating made up 42% of the total energy use and heating water was 30%. The remaining energy was consumed for cooling, lighting, refrigeration, and other appliances, which were 2%, 4%, 7%, and 15% respectively in the total energy use.

The situation of greenhouse gas emissions in every Australian household was not as identical as its energy use. The part of water heating is virtually the same as other appliances, and they made up the largest parts of total emissions, with 32% and 28% respectively. At the same time, the situation of heating and refrigeration is also similar, which made up 15% and 14% of gross emissions. As for the rest of the items, including cooling and lighting, they occupied 3% and 8% of the greenhouse gas emissions.

The two charts show the sales breakdown for Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004 in five European nations.

First, coffee sales in the UK skyrocketed dramatically between 1999 and 2004 from 1.5-20 million euros. The situation in 1999 and 2004 in Switzerland and Belgium displayed similar increased trend, with sales of coffee increasing largely from 3-6 million euros and from 1-1.7 million euros, while in Denmark and Sweden sales rose slightly from 1.8-2 million euros and from 0.8-1 million euros respectively. 

Secondly, sales of bananas in Switzerland, the UK, and Belgium in 1999 and 2004 doubled several times from 15-47, from 1-5.5, and from 0.6-4 million euros respectively. By contrast, the situation in Sweden and Denmark was different, in which sales of bananas in 1999 and 2004 in Sweden decreased largely from 1.8-1 million euros, while in Denmark sales also declined significantly from 2-0.9 million euros.

Comparing the two tables, it is clear that the UK sold the most amount of coffee in 2004, while Switzerland sold the most amount of bananas in 1999 and 2004.

The charts illustrate the data that graduate and undergraduate students in the UK did not participate in full-time jobs after graduation in 2008.

First, the number of graduates in the UK in 2008 taking tertiary education was 29665, while the number of graduates choosing part-time work and unemployment was roughly identical, with 17735 and 16235 respectively. Moreover, only 3500 graduates engaged in voluntary work, which was the least proportion of the total number. 

Secondly, the situation in postgraduates in the UK at the same time was different. The number of postgraduates who took part in part-time jobs and further study in 2008 was similar, with 2535 and 2725 respectively. Furthermore, the number of unemployed postgraduates was 1625, while only 345 did voluntary work after graduation.

Comparing these two graphs, it is clear that the number of graduates and postgraduates attending tertiary education was more than other items among their peers. Also, voluntary work made up the fewest proportion of total graduates and postgraduates.
