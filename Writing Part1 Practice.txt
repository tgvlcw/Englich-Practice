The two pie charts show the energy use in every Australian household and the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption.

The vast majority of energy was consumed for heating and water heating in each Australian household. Heating made up 42% of the total energy use and heating water was 30%. The remaining energy was consumed for cooling, lighting, refrigeration, and other appliances, which were 2%, 4%, 7%, and 15% respectively in the total energy use.

The situation of greenhouse gas emissions in every Australian household was not as identical as its energy use. The part of water heating is virtually the same as other appliances, and they made up the largest parts of total emissions, with 32% and 28% respectively. At the same time, the situation of heating and refrigeration is also similar, which made up 15% and 14% of gross emissions. As for the rest of the items, including cooling and lighting, they occupied 3% and 8% of the greenhouse gas emissions.

The two charts show the sales breakdown for Fairtrade-labelled coffee and bananas in 1999 and 2004 in five European nations.

First, coffee sales in the UK skyrocketed dramatically between 1999 and 2004 from 1.5-20 million euros. The situation in 1999 and 2004 in Switzerland and Belgium displayed similar increased trend, with sales of coffee increasing largely from 3-6 million euros and from 1-1.7 million euros, while in Denmark and Sweden sales rose slightly from 1.8-2 million euros and from 0.8-1 million euros respectively. 

Secondly, sales of bananas in Switzerland, the UK, and Belgium in 1999 and 2004 doubled several times from 15-47, from 1-5.5, and from 0.6-4 million euros respectively. By contrast, the situation in Sweden and Denmark was different, in which sales of bananas in 1999 and 2004 in Sweden decreased largely from 1.8-1 million euros, while in Denmark sales also declined significantly from 2-0.9 million euros.

Comparing the two tables, it is clear that the UK sold the most amount of coffee in 2004, while Switzerland sold the most amount of bananas in 1999 and 2004.

The charts illustrate the data that graduate and undergraduate students in the UK did not participate in full-time jobs after graduation in 2008.

First, the number of graduates in the UK in 2008 taking tertiary education was 29665, while the number of graduates choosing part-time work and unemployment was roughly identical, with 17735 and 16235 respectively. Moreover, only 3500 graduates engaged in voluntary work, which was the least proportion of the total number. 

Secondly, the situation in postgraduates in the UK at the same time was different. The number of postgraduates who took part in part-time jobs and further study in 2008 was similar, with 2535 and 2725 respectively. Furthermore, the number of unemployed postgraduates was 1625, while only 345 did voluntary work after graduation.

Comparing these two graphs, it is clear that the number of graduates and postgraduates attending tertiary education was more than other items among their peers. Also, voluntary work made up the fewest proportion of total graduates and postgraduates.

The chart shows the life cycle of salmons and their range of length in various periods.

The life cycle of salmon begins with an adult salmon going from the open sea to the slow-moving upper river full of reeds and stones, and they would leave their eggs on the floor of the river before returning to the ocean. For about 5-6 months, their eggs would grow up into fry, 3-8 centimeters long. These kinds of small fishes then swim into the lower river along with the water flow and reside in this environment for about four years to adapt to the condition of fast flowing as well as develop mature enough to become a smolt with 12-15 centimeters lengths. Finally, they flow into the open sea and continue to feed for about five years before becoming adult salmon, 70-76 centimeters long, to return to the upper river beginning a new life cycle. 

From this graph, it is clear that a species of salmon's life cycle divides into three stages lasting several years, and different life stages require them to live in different environmental conditions.

These six charts show the proportion of water utilized for various purposes in six regions of the world, including North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and South East Asia.

To begin with, the portion of the water used for agriculture, industry, and domestic area in North America, South America, and Europe are different, but North America and Europe have a similar situation, with industrial use(48% and 53%), agricultural use(39% and 32%), and domestic use(13% and 15%) respectively. The percentage of water used for the same purposes in South America is 10%, 71%, and 10%. 

Secondly, the proportion of water utilized for agriculture, industry, and domestic area in Africa, Central Asia, and South East Asia is roughly identical, with 7%, 5%, 12% in industry, 9%, 7%, 7% in the domestic area, and 84%, 88%, 81% in agriculture.

Comparing these six charts, it is clear that North America and Europe are the places that include most of the developed countries in the world, approximately 50 percent of water is mainly used for industry, whereas other districts employed the vast majority of water for domestic use.
