The two pie charts show the energy use in every Australian household and the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption.

The vast majority of energy was consumed for heating and water heating in each Australian household. Heating made up 42% of the total energy use and heating water was 30%. The remaining energy was consumed for cooling, lighting, refrigeration, and other appliances, which were 2%, 4%, 7%, and 15% respectively in the total energy use.

The situation of greenhouse gas emissions in every Australian household was not as identical as its energy use. The part of water heating is virtually the same as other appliances, and they made up the largest parts of total emissions, with 32% and 28% respectively. At the same time, the situation of heating and refrigeration is also similar, which made up 15% and 14% of gross emissions. As for the rest of the items, including cooling and lighting, they occupied 3% and 8% of the greenhouse gas emissions.
