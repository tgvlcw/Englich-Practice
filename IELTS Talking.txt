Describe a class you've taken. Why did you take it? What did you learn?

I majored in computer science and technology in college, so I took many computer-related courses. One of those courses is impressive me very much. It was called Embedded System Development and Design.
It was a compulsory course for my major, so I studied this course very seriously. It looked interesting, challenging and important to me since it was associated with my current work field.
I'm glad I studied it. It was a good and interesting class, and I learned a lot of useful and fundamental knowledge that was essential for my present work.
For example, I learned about how to design hardware, how to measure electronic signals, and how to write a source code and download it into the hardware properly. Now I understand how important the embedded system is in our daily life. I also learned a lot of debugging skills to make sure an electronic appliance works well.
The knowledge I learned in this course will help me a lot. I can not imagine how my career will become without learning this course. I still have a lot to learn, but this course was a good start.


Describe a public place you often visit in your hometown. Is it a popular place? Why do you go there?

I often go for a walk with my parents on a small path behind my house after dinner. Itâ€™s a very popular place. Many people living nearby would like to walk on this path in the evening.
This path is not so long, about one kilometer, you can see people do various activities on it, especially in the summer evening, such as walking, jogging, chatting and so on.
The main reason I go there is that I want to spend my spare time with my parents. I like watching the scenery along the way and enjoying the hustle and bustle of the surrounding crowd. It makes me feel very relaxed and calm.
This path is a good place for the elderly to relax. Sometimes we can encounter our relatives and friends occasionally, and then we greet each other and have a brief talk.
There are some other public places in my hometown, but this one is probably the nicest and the most popular. Sometimes it gets a little crowded because it's so welcome, but it's not a big problem.


Describe your favorite room in your home. What do you do there? Why do you like it?

There are lots of kinds of rooms in my house. I think the workroom is my favorite. That's where I spend most of my time at home. Although it's not the biggest room in my house, it's a very important and useful room for me.
I do a lot of things there. For example, I study and relax there. This room has some comfortable couches, a big table, and a television. So that's a good place to study and work, and I also read and watch movies.
I often do my job and watch outside of the window at the same time. Enjoying the sunlight and viewing the beautiful scenery. That's one of the main reasons I am fond of it.
This room is on the first floor of my three-story house, so it's very cool in the summer. And it's also the necessary place to get into my house, my parents and I usually treat our relatives and friends there.  It's very convenient.
The workroom is definitely my favorite room. I enjoy it more than other rooms, and I use it for many purposes. That's why I choose it to be my workroom.


Describe a TV show or movie that made a strong impression on you. What was it about? Why did it make an impression on you?

I mostly watch science fiction, action, and comedy movies when I have free time. And science fiction movies are my favorite. There is a film, called Avatar, which gives a strong impression on me. 
The plot of this movie happens several hundred years later. The earth is suffering from a shortage of natural resources. Fortunately, human beings have discovered a new planet that has rich natural resources that can be used and exploited by humans. And then the earth government decides to colonize that planet. So a war between original inhabitants and human beings started. A person who was born on earth helps original inhabitants fight against earth humans. At last, they got the victory in the war, but this person will die because he was hurt seriously.  And the original inhabitants use a special kind of magic to turn this earthman into a native person and to save his life at the same time.
This movie impresses me very much because it is the first movie that used 3D technology all over the world. Many sceneries and landscapes in this movie are very attractive. I cannot imagine how fantastic this movie is, when I first watched this movie in the cinema, more impressive than I watched ever before.


Describe an app that you often use on your phone. Why do you use it often? What do you like about it?

There are various apps installed on my mobile phone. Some of them I use every day. Such as the email app, the chat app,  some studying apps, and so on. But there is a special app, called Shanbei Listening, I use it for studying English almost every day.
From this app's name you can know this is an English studying app that only focuses on listening. There are lots of features on this app, but three of them are my favorite. First, I sometimes feel boring when I study English alone, so I can find a companion in this app. We can communicate with each other, and discuss the studying methods, and the most important is to encourage each other to study English. Second, many videos in this app are spoken by native speakers. The speaking speed of some videos is very quickly I can not follow. So this app supplies a repeated listening function that I can listen to sentence by sentence from the beginning until I can listen to it clearly and understand it completely. Third, when I watch a video, the subtitles can display bottom the cell phone screen at the same time. However, some of the words I can not understand, I only need to click this word with my finger and add it to my dictionary so that I can study and memorize this word later.
I used some English studying apps, but this one is the most useful for me. I have used it for half a year. Thanks for this app not only improves my listening skill, and also expands my English vocabulary which is beneficial for my English reading skill. I believe I will use this app all the time until I can watch English movies without subtitles.


Describe something you own that's very important to you. When did you get it? Why is it important?

So many kinds of stuff are very important for me in my life, such as my first laptop, first toy, first job, and so on. But there is one particular thing, I would like to say it is a bicycle, which is very helpful. Although it's not my first bicycle, it's the most important one.
I got this bicycle 5 years ago and bought it from the Internet for 800 yuans. I decide to buy it because my company is 3 kilometers away from my home at that time, and sometimes the traffic jam is severe on the way to my company, especially on rainy days. I ride this bike to work almost every day, and I often bike it with my friends to the suburban area on the weekends. Unfortunately, it was stolen one year after. I felt very sad. 
This bicycle is the most important for me because it helps me respond to the government's green travel plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,  and it practices my physical body and keeps me in shape at the same time. Even though it was stolen, I still need to thank this bicycle for staying with me for one year. I believe I will never forget it in my life.



Describe a current hobby. Why did you start this hobby? What do you like about it?
To be honest, I have some hobbies that I would like to talk about, such as skiing, swimming, listening to music, and so on. But a unique sport called high-intensity interval training, which comprises running, jumping, and some other motions, is currently one of my favorite hobbies.
I have heard some news on the Internet that a person sitting for more than 6 hours every day will be at high risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other sicknesses. So in order to stay healthy, I downloaded a suite of sports videos from the Internet called T25 and followed the coach's actions. This suite of sports videos has 3 advantages: 
1, I only exercise 5 times per week, no need for every day, and I have two days to recover and rest. 
2, Although every video only lasts 25 minutes, I can't get a break during the training. 
3, The training effect of this sport is fantastic, I only exercise it for roughly 3 months, and I can see my abs in front of the mirror.
Doing this special sport has become my current favorite hobby, because it not only exercises my physical body and helps me avoid a sub-health state, but also keeps a clear head and a good mood for me every day. Thanks to this sport improving my body a lot, I believe I will do it constantly in the future.



Describe a memorable event in your life. What happened? Why was it memorable? 
There are some memorable experiences in my lives, such as first studying skiing, first using an electric toothbrush, and so on. But the most memorable event for me is first having a date with a girl in college.
When I was a college student, I invited a girl I knew in an optional course to have a date with me, and she agreed. At the dating point, I could not believe what my eyes saw when she appeared in my vision
. She was wearing a white dress and walking toward me with a smile. She's so attractive to me that I could not speak a word at the beginning. In order to give her a good impression, I was obliged to talk many my high school life on the way. Then, we walked along the river after having dinner at a restaurant. At last, I took her back to the dormitory.
Although she didn't become my girlfriend later, I still felt this was a memorable experience because I could overcome my anxiety during the appointment. It proved that I was not afraid of talking with a girl. Thanks to this girl for accepting my date invitation. I think I would bury this event into my brain deeply.


Describe someone who has had a significant influence on your life. What are some of their qualities? Why have they had an influence on you?
There are some people in my life who have had significant influences on me, such as my father, my first teacher, and so on. But I think the most significant effect on me was my second leader whom I worked with in my second company after I graduated from college.
I used to be a software engineer and only had one year of work experience before I started working in my second company. I knew nothing about the company at the beginning and didn't familiarize anyone around me. So my leader was the first one to stand out to help me. He is a generous and patient person who constantly teaches me how to construct my own thinking framework when facing difficulties, how to edit source codes as a  software engineer, not just copy and paste codes as a coding machine, and how to clarify your goals by practicing. He also assisted me in other aspects of work, such as scheduling an interview with Amazon for me when he worked at Amazon. I was very grateful to him that I couldn't imagine what my career would become without his assistance and suggestions on work.
Although he immigrated to Canada in 2016, we still keep in touch with each other and often discuss some of the newest computer technology trends on the Internet.




Describe the most successful member of your family. What do they do? Why are they successful?
Different people mean different understandings of success. If I had to choose one family member to be the most successful, I think that was my father. 
My father only gained a technical secondary school diploma, but that is almost identical to the undergraduate diploma these days or even higher. He has several special techniques and skills in his life. He is an electrician who connects electric wires and repairs electric equipment. When I was a kid, the community where my family lived often suffered power cuts at night because the fuse was broken. So my father was the first person to stand out to repair it for free. That's one reason I am proud of my father. He is also a carpenter who made most of my family's furniture, such as a wardrobe, some tables, and chairs which have worked well for over 30 years. Moreover, he runs a small business that raises the whole family and supports me in finishing my college studies.
In my observation, my father's success is mainly based on his hard work, profound knowledge in the professional field, and patience with everybody and everything. Therefore, I do believe my father is the best sample of success for me.



Study IETLS brother:

1st day 6th day:

Describe a city that you think is very interesting. Where it is? What it is famous for? How you knew this city? Why do you think it is very interesting?

I have visited several cities in the past ten years, like Beijing, Shanghai, and even a foreign city, San Francisco, which I think was the most interesting among all cities I visited.

When I was a kid, I heard the name of this city many times on TV, but I never thought I would have a chance to visit it someday. Luckily, the company where I used to work 10 years ago asked me to go to San Francisco on business. I was so excited and happy when I heard this news. This city is located in the United States, and it took over 10 hours to get there by plane from my country. When I arrived in this city, the first thing that impressed me was its weather, like fresh air, beautiful landscapes, and a clear sky. The second was how amiable the people were, and everyone said hello to me. Aside from routine work, my colleagues and I visited many places on the weekends: one was the Golden Gate Bridge, one of the most famous scenic spots and attracts people from all over the world to see; the other was the Silicon Valley, the dream place for every software engineer worldwide and established some great companies, such as Apple, Google, and so on. I even saw a squirrel eating food and climbing trees beside our hotel, which I never saw in China. 

Although the business trip only lasted half a month, it was the most meaningful and unforgettable experience in my life. If I have another chance to go to the United States, I would like to visit San Francisco again.     



2nd day:

Describe a long walk you ever had. When this happened? Where you walked? Who you were with? How did you feel about this long walk?

As human beings, we almost walk every day, like going to school, walking to the workplace, and even going for a walk to relax. If I had to describe a long walk that has happened in recent times, I think it would be visiting my grandfather's grave at the Qingming Festival this year.

Visiting our ancestor's graves is one of the traditional Chinese cultures, which is an important activity for every Chinese family, especially during the Chinese Spring Festival and the Qingming Festival. Since I went to college and worked in other cities for more than 10 years, I have never visited my grandfather's grave. So this was the first time in the past ten years. That day was a sunny day with fresh air. My parents, my mother's relatives, and I decided to visit my grandfather's grave. The destination was 30 kilometers away from my home, so we had to take a bus at first, then walk 5 kilometers to get there. Everything around the path has changed a lot. I remembered nothing except the hill where my grandfather was buried. Luckily, we spent one hour finding the right way in the end. Although the sweat soaked my clothes, I thought it was very wealthy and meaningful. We had a picnic beside the grave, chatting with each other, enjoying the beautiful landscapes on the top of the mountain, and kneeling in front of the grave to pray for luck and health in the future before we left. 

These days, visiting our ancestors' graves is not only a serious matter but a big family activity to maintain a good relationship between relatives. I am looking forward to the huge family activity at the next Spring Festival.


3th day:

Describe a rule you dislike and would like to change in the future. What it is? What it is for? Why you don't like it? Why you would like to change it?

As modern society constantly develops, many unfair regulations involving personal interests perplex everybody in my country today, such as age discrimination, gender discrimination, and academic discrimination. If I had to choose one regulation that I want to change the most, I think it would be age discrimination. That is, those people over 35 years old will not be considered.

In my country, if you open a recruitment APP, you will find out this regulation that is often highlighted in many companies' job descriptions. I think two reasons can explain this phenomenon. First, more than 10 million college students have just graduated from university in recent years, and they all want to find a good job. But the headcounts are limited. If a company employs a young adult, they must replace the other one whose age is over 35 years old. Second, compared to older employees, younger employees are more willing to work overtime, require lower salaries, and are more energetic. In my opinion, I extremely dislike this regulation because everyone all gets old. A person's ability to work is mainly based on his work efficiency and enthusiasm for work rather than his age. A person over 35 years old doesn't mean he lacks work passion and ability.
 
Suppose I don't stand up and change this regulation. In that case, it's imaginable that I will not be able to get a suitable job to afford my family before I retire. And I may feel like a useless person to society. So I must break this regulation with my rich work experience and excellent professional skill. Telling my prospective boss I am the one that you're looking for.


4th day:

Describe a person who you follow on social media. Who he/she is? How did you know him/her? What he/she posts on social media? Why you follow him/her on social media?

As computer technology constantly develops, many celebrities and ordinary people are active on social media today. If I had to choose one person I want to talk about the most. It would be Koo Tin Lok, who is one of the Chinese movie stars I respect the most.

His Chinese name is Koo Tin Lok, and his English name is Louis Koo. I have seen him many times on TV during my childhood. Unlike other performers who have retired after earning a lot of money, he is over 50 and continues to play many important roles in movies. I followed his Sina Weibo several years ago and checked his latest status almost every week. A recent posting on his Weibo announced that the movie Warriors of Future will run next month. This film is his first science fiction film which has been produced for more than 10 years. As seen in the trailer, he acted as a warrior fighting against aliens. The reason that I respect him is that he invested large amounts of money earned from movies in Chinese education. Many schools named after him were built in poor Chinese areas. For the past 20 years, he has helped many children to continue their studies. I often see pictures of him and poor kids on social media. I feel a sense of pride and respect for him when I view these pictures.

To support his career, I decided to watch every movie he is in. I'm looking forward to watching Warriors of Future next month. Sincerely wish him a successful box office.


5th day:
Describe a special day out that cost you little money/didn't cost you much. When the day was? Where you went? How much you spent? How you feel about the day?

As my country's epidemic situation is not over, many people have to spend less money during this period. If I have to choose a day, I spend little money on that day. That was the day I spent in a holiday village several months ago. 

My aunt invited my family to go to a holiday village. The epidemic situation has improved, my aunt said. In order to attract more people to visit the holiday village, the boss of this resort decided to reduce the entrance fee to half. When we heard this news, my parents and I accepted my aunt's invitation. So my aunt drove a car to take us to get there. The holiday village is located in my hometown's suburban area. When we arrived at the resort, I couldn't believe it was true. We only spent 25 yuan per person to enter the holiday village, half the price of the usual fee. If the epidemic hadn't affected the holiday village, we would have to spend 50 yuan per person or even more on the national holidays. Many people were already in the resort when we crossed the gate of the holiday village. We chose a suitable camp place and started preparing a picnic, playing Mahjong, and enjoying the resort's beautiful landscapes. We had a good time at the resort. At last, we returned home in the evening.

Due to the spread of the epidemic at the beginning of this year, many people, including my family, are struggling to reduce daily expenses. To relieve the dreadful feeling caused by an epidemic, it's also good to spend less money on visiting a holiday village. I hope the epidemic situation will end as soon as possible.


6th day & 1th day:
Describe a time you visited a new place. Where the new place is? When you went there? Why you went there? How do you feel about the place?

As public transportation develops constantly, I can go to many places I have never visited before. If I had to choose a new place I visited, I think it's a foreign city, San Francisco, which I only visited once.

I have heard the name of this city many times on TV during my childhood. But I never thought I would have a chance to visit it. Luckily, the company where I used to work ten years ago asked me to go to San Francisco on business. I felt excited and happy when I heard this news. This city is located in the United States, and I flew more than ten hours to get there. When I arrived in this city, the first thing that impressed me was how clean and fresh the air was. The second was how amiable the people were, and everyone said hello to me. Aside from my daily routine work, my colleagues and I also went to a few places on the weekends: one was the Golden Gate Bridge, one of the most famous sights in the world, attracting people from all over the world to see; the other one was Silicon Valley, the dream place for every software engineer worldwide which established many great companies, such as Google, Apple and so on.

Although the business trip only lasted half a month and there were so many interesting and beautiful tourist attractions that I didn't have enough time to visit yet, I thought it was the most meaningful and unforgettable experience in my life. If I have another chance to go to the United States, I would like to visit San Francisco again.


7th day:
Describe a thing you did to learn another language. What language you learned? What you did? How it helped you learn the language? How you felt about it?

As modern society develops constantly, more and more people start learning English for many reasons, like studying abroad, traveling to other countries, and making foreign friends. Studying English includes four parts: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. I think speaking is the most significant part I need to pay attention to.

There are many English learning apps on the Internet. Finding the most suitable one for me is a big problem. After testing several APPs, I decided to use one, ELSA Speaking, to improve my speaking skills. Unlike other apps that only focus on imitating pronunciation, this app improves your pronunciation as well as intonation. With more than one thousand courses in this app, you can practice. Each course contains several words and sentences you can repeatedly read aloud to improve pronunciation. This app can detect precisely which word you speak unclearly, and which syllable you pronounce incorrectly and give you detailed advice. Following the suggestions, practicing your mouth muscles, and repeatedly pronouncing will eventually correct your pronunciation. I have used this app for over three months. In the beginning, the scoring system only gave me 55 points based on my pronunciation, intonation, and fluency, but now I can get 70 points.

This APP is very popular on the Google Play market and has been downloaded over 10 million times. I strongly recommend that everyone learning English use this APP immediately. I will continue to use this APP for at least one year until the scoring system gives me 80 points. I will do whatever I can to accomplish my goal.


8th day:
Describe a friend you like to talk with. Who he/she is? What you like to talk about? Why you like to talk with him/her? How you feel about him/her?

There are some friends on the Internet with whom I often talk. If I had to choose one of my friends I often chat with the most, I think that would be one of my colleagues.

We worked at the same company several years ago. He is a generous and patient person who sometimes gives me assistance at work. After we had worked together for two years, he decided to study abroad in Canada to start his new life. Even so, we often communicate with each other on the Internet. He now knows I'm preparing for the IETLS examination. So we discuss some study methods for preparing for the test. In his experience, he suggests I don't need to waste much time on reading and listening. The most important things I had to focus on were speaking and writing. He has two tips about speaking: I must prepare at least 30 topics based on my experience before my speaking test; additionally, using several keywords to construct my whole story rather than just memorizing these topics. He also thought that writing was the most challenging part of English. He advised me to expand my vocabulary and not use fixed frames in my essay.

Aside from talking about studying English, we also talk about other topics, like computer technology trends and his study experience in Canada. Although he decided to stay in Canada after graduation, maybe we would never have a chance to meet each other, but we still kept a good friendship. Thanks to him for helping me with learning English. I hope everything goes well for him in Canada. 


9th day:
Describe an important river/lake in your country. Where it is located? How big/long it is? What it looks like? Why it is imiportant?

Many rivers are located in my country, like the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and so on. If I had to choose one river that matters the most to my nation. I think that would be the Yangtze River.

My elementary school textbooks illustrated this river when I was a kid. The Yangtze River is the longest river, over sixty-three hundred kilometers in my country, and crosses over eleven provinces. It flows into the ocean from west to east. It looks like a dragon on the map, and there is even a line of lyrics describing this river. Many people in my country are brought up by it. Even the capital of my country, Beijing, is more than one thousand kilometers away from this river. This city's drinking water mainly depends on it. I think it's the most significant river in my country because the living conditions of countless people living on this territory over the past thousands of years have much to do with this river. 

Aside from providing fresh water for people, it can be used for irrigation, transportation, and industry. She can be both a mother and a destroyer if we don't take care to preserve her. I can't imagine how my nation's people would live or find more suitable drinking water without the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, I never saw this river at a short distance except on TV or on the Internet. If I have a chance, I would like to view this river with my own eyes. 


10th day:

Describe a family member who you want to work with in the future. Who he/she is? Whether you worked together before? What kind of work you would like to do with him/her? How you feel about this family member.

The relationship between Chinese relatives is complex, so there are many members in a traditional Chinese family, like my aunts, uncles, nephews, and so on. If I had to choose one of my family members with whom I want to work the most. I think that would be one of my older female cousins. 

She is 4 years older than me and lives in another city. As a result, we are unable to meet very often. In my memory, she is an extroverted and diligent salesman selling products on the Internet. Once she resolves to do something challenging, she will take action to achieve it as soon as possible without hesitation. But she isn't good at any computer skills. Compared to me, a software engineer, I am an introvert who has difficulty making decisions quickly since I constantly worry about what problems I will face and the best way to deal with them. So I think it's possible for us to use our advantages to counteract each other's weaknesses. Running a small business online or selling goods in a live broadcast. She can take advantage of her merits and remarkable eloquence to sell items on the Internet. And I can use my professional skills to tackle any technical issues.

Although all of these come from my imagination, we might never work together because we live in different cities and work in different fields. But nothing is impossible. Perhaps we really have a chance to work together and do some surprising things someday. Who knows.


11th day:
Describe an interesting neighbor. Who he/she is? How you knew him/her? What you do together? Why he/she is interesting?

There are several neighbors live nearby my house. If I had to choose one of them that is the most interesting. I think that would be an old couple living next to my house. 

When I was a kid, this couple lived next to my house up to now for about 20 years. We often greet each other if we meet outside of our house. Due to we are the different generations and have different work and rest habits, we don't work or play together. But we are all fond of shopping online, and usually help each other receive the packages if they or my family weren't at home. There are two things that always make me laugh and I think they are very interesting. One is the older woman often swears the man who didn't do something better by using local dialect, and the man didn't give any response to the woman besides lowering his head. The other one is the woman feeds a beautiful and cute cat, I don't know what type of it. And she never allows the cat to go out of the house. If the cat does so, the voice of calling the cat can be heard at a long distance. Therefore, the cat is very shy and scary in front of strangers whenever I saw it. 

Although the couple and my family never do something together, we would do same things at some special festivals, such as pasting red couplets and firecrackers at the Chinese Spring Festival, visiting our ansector's graves at the Qingming festival, and so on. In order to maintain good relationships, we sometime help each other in our daily lives.
