Describe a class you've taken. Why did you take it? What did you learn?

I majored in computer science and technology in college, so I took many computer-related courses. One of those courses is impressive me very much. It was called Embedded System Development and Design.
It was a compulsory course for my major, so I studied this course very seriously. It looked interesting, challenging and important to me since it was associated with my current work field.
I'm glad I studied it. It was a good and interesting class, and I learned a lot of useful and fundamental knowledge that was essential for my present work.
For example, I learned about how to design hardware, how to measure electronic signals, and how to write a source code and download it into the hardware properly. Now I understand how important the embedded system is in our daily life. I also learned a lot of debugging skills to make sure an electronic appliance works well.
The knowledge I learned in this course will help me a lot. I can not imagine how my career will become without learning this course. I still have a lot to learn, but this course was a good start.


Describe a public place you often visit in your hometown. Is it a popular place? Why do you go there?

I often go for a walk with my parents on a small path behind my house after dinner. Itâ€™s a very popular place. Many people living nearby would like to walk on this path in the evening.
This path is not so long, about one kilometer, you can see people do various activities on it, especially in the summer evening, such as walking, jogging, chatting and so on.
The main reason I go there is that I want to spend my spare time with my parents. I like watching the scenery along the way and enjoying the hustle and bustle of the surrounding crowd. It makes me feel very relaxed and calm.
This path is a good place for the elderly to relax. Sometimes we can encounter our relatives and friends occasionally, and then we greet each other and have a brief talk.
There are some other public places in my hometown, but this one is probably the nicest and the most popular. Sometimes it gets a little crowded because it's so welcome, but it's not a big problem.


Describe your favorite room in your home. What do you do there? Why do you like it?

There are lots of kinds of rooms in my house. I think the workroom is my favorite. That's where I spend most of my time at home. Although it's not the biggest room in my house, it's a very important and useful room for me.
I do a lot of things there. For example, I study and relax there. This room has some comfortable couches, a big table, and a television. So that's a good place to study and work, and I also read and watch movies.
I often do my job and watch outside of the window at the same time. Enjoying the sunlight and viewing the beautiful scenery. That's one of the main reasons I am fond of it.
This room is on the first floor of my three-story house, so it's very cool in the summer. And it's also the necessary place to get into my house, my parents and I usually treat our relatives and friends there.  It's very convenient.
The workroom is definitely my favorite room. I enjoy it more than other rooms, and I use it for many purposes. That's why I choose it to be my workroom.


Describe a TV show or movie that made a strong impression on you. What was it about? Why did it make an impression on you?

I mostly watch science fiction, action, and comedy movies when I have free time. And science fiction movies are my favorite. There is a film, called Avatar, which gives a strong impression on me. 
The plot of this movie happens several hundred years later. The earth is suffering from a shortage of natural resources. Fortunately, human beings have discovered a new planet that has rich natural resources that can be used and exploited by humans. And then the earth government decides to colonize that planet. So a war between original inhabitants and human beings started. A person who was born on earth helps original inhabitants fight against earth humans. At last, they got the victory in the war, but this person will die because he was hurt seriously.  And the original inhabitants use a special kind of magic to turn this earthman into a native person and to save his life at the same time.
This movie impresses me very much because it is the first movie that used 3D technology all over the world. Many sceneries and landscapes in this movie are very attractive. I cannot imagine how fantastic this movie is, when I first watched this movie in the cinema, more impressive than I watched ever before.


Describe an app that you often use on your phone. Why do you use it often? What do you like about it?

There are various apps installed on my mobile phone. Some of them I use every day. Such as the email app, the chat app,  some studying apps, and so on. But there is a special app, called Shanbei Listening, I use it for studying English almost every day.
From this app's name you can know this is an English studying app that only focuses on listening. There are lots of features on this app, but three of them are my favorite. First, I sometimes feel boring when I study English alone, so I can find a companion in this app. We can communicate with each other, and discuss the studying methods, and the most important is to encourage each other to study English. Second, many videos in this app are spoken by native speakers. The speaking speed of some videos is very quickly I can not follow. So this app supplies a repeated listening function that I can listen to sentence by sentence from the beginning until I can listen to it clearly and understand it completely. Third, when I watch a video, the subtitles can display bottom the cell phone screen at the same time. However, some of the words I can not understand, I only need to click this word with my finger and add it to my dictionary so that I can study and memorize this word later.
I used some English studying apps, but this one is the most useful for me. I have used it for half a year. Thanks for this app not only improves my listening skill, and also expands my English vocabulary which is beneficial for my English reading skill. I believe I will use this app all the time until I can watch English movies without subtitles.


Describe something you own that's very important to you. When did you get it? Why is it important?

So many kinds of stuff are very important for me in my life, such as my first laptop, first toy, first job, and so on. But there is one particular thing, I would like to say it is a bicycle, which is very helpful. Although it's not my first bicycle, it's the most important one.
I got this bicycle 5 years ago and bought it from the Internet for 800 yuans. I decide to buy it because my company is 3 kilometers away from my home at that time, and sometimes the traffic jam is severe on the way to my company, especially on rainy days. I ride this bike to work almost every day, and I often bike it with my friends to the suburban area on the weekends. Unfortunately, it was stolen one year after. I felt very sad. 
This bicycle is the most important for me because it helps me respond to the government's green travel plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,  and it practices my physical body and keeps me in shape at the same time. Even though it was stolen, I still need to thank this bicycle for staying with me for one year. I believe I will never forget it in my life.



Describe a current hobby. Why did you start this hobby? What do you like about it?
To be honest, I have some hobbies that I would like to talk about, such as skiing, swimming, listening to music, and so on. But a unique sport called high-intensity interval training, which comprises running, jumping, and some other motions, is currently one of my favorite hobbies.
I have heard some news on the Internet that a person sitting for more than 6 hours every day will be at high risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other sicknesses. So in order to stay healthy, I downloaded a suite of sports videos from the Internet called T25 and followed the coach's actions. This suite of sports videos has 3 advantages: 
1, I only exercise 5 times per week, no need for every day, and I have two days to recover and rest. 
2, Although every video only lasts 25 minutes, I can't get a break during the training. 
3, The training effect of this sport is fantastic, I only exercise it for roughly 3 months, and I can see my abs in front of the mirror.
Doing this special sport has become my current favorite hobby, because it not only exercises my physical body and helps me avoid a sub-health state, but also keeps a clear head and a good mood for me every day. Thanks to this sport improving my body a lot, I believe I will do it constantly in the future.



Describe a memorable event in your life. What happened? Why was it memorable? 
There are some memorable experiences in my lives, such as first studying skiing, first using an electric toothbrush, and so on. But the most memorable event for me is first having a date with a girl in college.
When I was a college student, I invited a girl I knew in an optional course to have a date with me, and she agreed. At the dating point, I could not believe what my eyes saw when she appeared in my vision
. She was wearing a white dress and walking toward me with a smile. She's so attractive to me that I could not speak a word at the beginning. In order to give her a good impression, I was obliged to talk many my high school life on the way. Then, we walked along the river after having dinner at a restaurant. At last, I took her back to the dormitory.
Although she didn't become my girlfriend later, I still felt this was a memorable experience because I could overcome my anxiety during the appointment. It proved that I was not afraid of talking with a girl. Thanks to this girl for accepting my date invitation. I think I would bury this event into my brain deeply.


Describe someone who has had a significant influence on your life. What are some of their qualities? Why have they had an influence on you?
There are some people in my life who have had significant influences on me, such as my father, my first teacher, and so on. But I think the most significant effect on me was my second leader whom I worked with in my second company after I graduated from college.
I used to be a software engineer and only had one year of work experience before I started working in my second company. I knew nothing about the company at the beginning and didn't familiarize anyone around me. So my leader was the first one to stand out to help me. He is a generous and patient person who constantly teaches me how to construct my own thinking framework when facing difficulties, how to edit source codes as a  software engineer, not just copy and paste codes as a coding machine, and how to clarify your goals by practicing. He also assisted me in other aspects of work, such as scheduling an interview with Amazon for me when he worked at Amazon. I was very grateful to him that I couldn't imagine what my career would become without his assistance and suggestions on work.
Although he immigrated to Canada in 2016, we still keep in touch with each other and often discuss some of the newest computer technology trends on the Internet.




Describe the most successful member of your family. What do they do? Why are they successful?
Different people mean different understandings of success. If I had to choose one family member to be the most successful, I think that was my father. 
My father only gained a technical secondary school diploma, but that is almost identical to the undergraduate diploma these days or even higher. He has several special techniques and skills in his life. He is an electrician who connects electric wires and repairs electric equipment. When I was a kid, the community where my family lived often suffered power cuts at night because the fuse was broken. So my father was the first person to stand out to repair it for free. That's one reason I am proud of my father. He is also a carpenter who made most of my family's furniture, such as a wardrobe, some tables, and chairs which have worked well for over 30 years. Moreover, he runs a small business that raises the whole family and supports me in finishing my college studies.
In my observation, my father's success is mainly based on his hard work, profound knowledge in the professional field, and patience with everybody and everything. Therefore, I do believe my father is the best sample of success for me.

Describe a city that you think is very interesting. Where it is? What it is famous for? How you knew this city? Why do you think it is very interesting?

I have visited several cities in the past ten years, like Beijing, Shanghai, and even a foreign city, San Francisco, which I think it was the most interesting among all cities I visited.

When I was a kid, I heard the name of this city many times on TV, but I never thought I would have a chance to visit it someday. Luckily, the company where I used to work 10 years ago asked me to go to San Francisco on business. I was so excited and happy when I heard this news. This city is located in the United States, and it took over 10 hours to get there by plane from my country. When I arrived in this city, the first thing that impressed me was its weather, like fresh air, beautiful landscapes, and a clear sky. The second was how amiable the people were, and everyone said hello to me. Aside from routine work, my colleagues and I visited many places on the weekends: one was the Golden Gate Bridge, one of the most famous scenic spots and attracts people from all over the world to see; the other was the Silicon Valley, the dream place for every software engineer worldwide and established some great companies, such as Apple, Google, and so on. I even saw a squirrel eating food and climbing trees beside our hotel, which I never saw in China. 

Although the business trip only lasted half a month, it was the most meaningful and unforgettable experience in my life. If I have another chance to go to the United States, I would like to visit San Francisco again.

Describe a long walk you ever had. When this happened? Where you walked? Who you were with? How did you feel about this long walk?

As human beings, we almost walk every day, like going to school, walking to the workplace, and even going for a walk to relax. If I had to describe a long walk that has happened in recent times, I think it would be visiting my grandfather's grave at the Qingming Festival this year.

Visiting our ancestor's graves is one of the traditional Chinese cultures, which is an important activity for every Chinese family, especially during the Chinese Spring Festival and the Qingming Festival. Since I went to college and worked in other cities for more than 10 years, I have never visited my grandfather's grave. So this was the first time in the past ten years. That day was a sunny day with fresh air. My parents, my mother's relatives, and I decided to visit my grandfather's grave. The destination was 30 kilometers away from my home, so we had to take a bus at first, then walk 5 kilometers to get there. Everything around the path has changed a lot. I remembered nothing except the hill where my grandfather was buried. Luckily, we spent one hour finding the right way in the end. Although the sweat soaked my clothes, I thought it was very wealthy and meaningful. We had a picnic beside the grave, chatting with each other, enjoying the beautiful landscapes on the top of the mountain, and kneeling in front of the grave to pray for luck and health in the future before we left. 

These days, visiting our ancestors' graves is not only a serious matter but a big family activity to maintain a good relationship between relatives. I am looking forward to the huge family activity at the next Spring Festival.

Describe a rule you dislike and would like to change in the future. What it is? What it is for? Why you don't like it? Why you would like to change it?

As modern society constantly develops, many unfair regulations involving personal interests perplex everybody in my country today, such as age discrimination, gender discrimination, and academic discrimination. If I had to choose one regulation that I want to change the most, I think it would be age discrimination. That is, those people over 35 years old will not be considered.

In my country, if you open a recruitment APP, you will find out this regulation that is often highlighted in many companies' job descriptions. I think two reasons can explain this phenomenon. First, more than 10 million college students have just graduated from university in recent years, and they all want to find a good job. But the headcounts are limited. If a company employs a young adult, they must replace the other one whose age is over 35 years old. Second, compared to older employees, younger employees are more willing to work overtime, require lower salaries, and are more energetic. In my opinion, I extremely dislike this regulation because everyone all gets old. A person's ability to work is mainly based on his work efficiency and enthusiasm for work rather than his age. A person over 35 years old doesn't mean he lacks work passion and ability.
 
Suppose I don't stand up and change this regulation. In that case, it's imaginable that I will not be able to get a suitable job to afford my family before I retire. And I may feel like a useless person to society. So I must break this regulation with my rich work experience and excellent professional skill. Telling my prospective boss I am the one that you're looking for.

Describe a person who you follow on social media. Who he/she is? How did you know him/her? What he/she posts on social media? Why you follow him/her on social media?

As computer technology constantly develops, many celebrities and ordinary people are active on social media today. If I had to choose one person I want to talk about the most. It would be Koo Tin Lok, who is one of the Chinese movie stars I respect the most.

His Chinese name is Koo Tin Lok, and his English name is Louis Koo. I have seen him many times on TV during my childhood. Unlike other performers who have retired after earning a lot of money, he is over 50 and continues to play many important roles in movies. I followed his Sina Weibo several years ago and checked his latest status almost every week. A recent posting on his Weibo announced that the movie Warriors of Future will run next month. This film is his first science fiction film which has been produced for more than 10 years. As seen in the trailer, he acted as a warrior fighting against aliens. The reason that I respect him is that he invested large amounts of money earned from movies in Chinese education. Many schools named after him were built in poor Chinese areas. For the past 20 years, he has helped many children to continue their studies. I often see pictures of him and poor kids on social media. I feel a sense of pride and respect for him when I view these pictures.

To support his career, I decided to watch every movie he is in. I'm looking forward to watching Warriors of Future next month. Sincerely wish him a successful box office.

Describe a special day out that cost you little money/didn't cost you much. When the day was? Where you went? How much you spent? How you feel about the day?

As my country's epidemic situation is not over, many people have to spend less money during this period. If I have to choose a day, I spend little money on that day. That was the day I spent in a holiday village several months ago. 

My aunt invited my family to go to a holiday village. The epidemic situation has improved, my aunt said. In order to attract more people to visit the holiday village, the boss of this resort decided to reduce the entrance fee to half. When we heard this news, my parents and I accepted my aunt's invitation. So my aunt drove a car to take us to get there. The holiday village is located in my hometown's suburban area. When we arrived at the resort, I couldn't believe it was true. We only spent 25 yuan per person to enter the holiday village, half the price of the usual fee. If the epidemic hadn't affected the holiday village, we would have to spend 50 yuan per person or even more on the national holidays. Many people were already in the resort when we crossed the gate of the holiday village. We chose a suitable camp place and started preparing a picnic, playing Mahjong, and enjoying the resort's beautiful landscapes. We had a good time at the resort. At last, we returned home in the evening.

Due to the spread of the epidemic at the beginning of this year, many people, including my family, are struggling to reduce daily expenses. To relieve the dreadful feeling caused by the epidemic, it's also good to spend less money on visiting a holiday village. I hope the epidemic situation will end as soon as possible.

Describe a time you visited a new place. Where the new place is? When you went there? Why you went there? How do you feel about the place?

As public transportation develops constantly, I can go to many places I have never visited before. If I had to choose a new place I visited, I think it's a foreign city, San Francisco, which I only visited once.

I have heard the name of this city many times on TV during my childhood. But I never thought I would have a chance to visit it. Luckily, the company where I used to work ten years ago asked me to go to San Francisco on business. I felt excited and happy when I heard this news. This city is located in the United States, and I flew more than ten hours to get there. When I arrived in this city, the first thing that impressed me was how clean and fresh the air was. The second was how amiable the people were, and everyone said hello to me. Aside from my daily routine work, my colleagues and I also went to a few places on the weekends: one was the Golden Gate Bridge, one of the most famous sights in the world, attracting people from all over the world to see; the other one was Silicon Valley, the dream place for every software engineer worldwide which has established many great companies, such as Google, Apple and so on.

Although the business trip only lasted half a month and there were so many interesting and beautiful tourist attractions that I didn't have enough time to visit yet, I thought it was the most meaningful and unforgettable experience in my life. If I have another chance to go to the United States, I would like to visit San Francisco again.

Describe a thing you did to learn another language. What language you learned? What you did? How it helped you learn the language? How you felt about it?

As modern society develops constantly, more and more people start learning English for many reasons, like studying abroad, traveling to other countries, and making foreign friends. Studying English includes four parts: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. I think speaking is the most significant part I need to pay attention to.

There are many English learning apps on the Internet. Finding the most suitable one for me is a big problem. After testing several APPs, I decided to use one, ELSA Speaking, to improve my speaking skills. Unlike other apps that only focus on imitating pronunciation, this app improves your pronunciation as well as intonation. With more than one thousand courses in this app, you can practice. Each course contains several words and sentences you can repeatedly read aloud to improve pronunciation. This app can detect precisely which word you speak unclearly, and which syllable you pronounce incorrectly and give you detailed advice. Following the suggestions, practicing your mouth muscles, and repeatedly pronouncing will eventually correct your pronunciation. I have used this app for over three months. In the beginning, the scoring system only gave me 55 points based on my pronunciation, intonation, and fluency, but now I can get 70 points.

This APP is very popular on the Google Play market and has been downloaded over 10 million times. I strongly recommend that everyone learning English use this APP immediately. I will continue to use this APP for at least one year until the scoring system gives me 80 points. I will do whatever I can to accomplish my goal.

Describe a friend you like to talk with. Who he/she is? What you like to talk about? Why you like to talk with him/her? How you feel about him/her?

There are some friends on the Internet with whom I often talk. If I had to choose one of my friends I often chat with the most, I think that would be one of my colleagues.

We worked at the same company several years ago. He is a generous and patient person who sometimes gives me assistance at work. After we had worked together for two years, he decided to study abroad in Canada to start his new life. Even so, we often communicate with each other on the Internet. He now knows I'm preparing for the IETLS examination. So we discuss some study methods for preparing for the test. In his experience, he suggests I don't need to waste much time on reading and listening. The most important things I had to focus on were speaking and writing. He has two tips about speaking: I must prepare at least 30 topics based on my experience before my speaking test; additionally, using several keywords to construct my whole story rather than just memorizing these topics. He also thought that writing was the most challenging part of English. He advised me to expand my vocabulary and not use fixed frames in my essay.

Aside from talking about studying English, we also talk about other topics, like computer technology trends and his study experience in Canada. Although he decided to stay in Canada after graduation, maybe we would never have a chance to meet each other, but we still kept a good friendship. Thanks to him for helping me with learning English. I hope everything goes well for him in Canada.

Describe an important river/lake in your country. Where it is located? How big/long it is? What it looks like? Why it is imiportant?

Many rivers are located in my country, like the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and so on. If I had to choose one river that matters the most to my nation. I think that would be the Yangtze River.

My elementary school textbooks illustrated this river when I was a kid. The Yangtze River is the longest river, over sixty-three hundred kilometers in my country, and crosses over eleven provinces. It flows into the ocean from west to east. It looks like a dragon on the map, and there is even a line of lyrics describing this river. Many people in my country are brought up by it. Even the capital of my country, Beijing, is more than one thousand kilometers away from this river. This city's drinking water mainly depends on it. I think it's the most significant river in my country because the living conditions of countless people living on this territory over the past thousands of years have much to do with this river. 

Aside from providing fresh water for people, it can be used for irrigation, transportation, and industry. She can be both a mother and a destroyer if we don't take care to preserve her. I can't imagine how my nation's people would live or find more suitable drinking water without the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, I never saw this river at a short distance except on TV or on the Internet. If I have a chance, I would like to view this river with my own eyes.

Describe a family member who you want to work with in the future. Who he/she is? Whether you worked together before? What kind of work you would like to do with him/her? How you feel about this family member.

The relationship between Chinese relatives is complex, so there are many members in a traditional Chinese family, like my aunts, uncles, nephews, and so on. If I had to choose one of my family members with whom I want to work the most. I think that would be one of my older female cousins. 

She is 4 years older than me and lives in another city. As a result, we are unable to meet very often. In my memory, she is an extroverted and diligent salesman selling products on the Internet. Once she resolves to do something challenging, she will take action to achieve it as soon as possible without hesitation. But she isn't good at any computer skills. Compared to me, a software engineer, I am an introvert who has difficulty making decisions quickly since I constantly worry about what problems I will face and the best way to deal with them. So I think it's possible for us to use our advantages to counteract each other's weaknesses. Running a small business online or selling goods in a live broadcast. She can take advantage of her merits and remarkable eloquence to sell items on the Internet. And I can use my professional skills to tackle any technical issues.

Although all of these come from my imagination, we might never work together because we live in different cities and work in different fields. But nothing is impossible. Perhaps we really have a chance to work together and do some surprising things someday. Who knows.

Describe an interesting neighbor. Who he/she is? How you knew him/her? What you do together? Why he/she is interesting?

Several neighbors live nearby my house. If I had to choose one of them that is the most interesting. I think that would be an old couple living next to my house.

This couple has lived next to my house for over 10 years since I was a kid. We often greet each other if we meet outside of our house. Due to we aren't the same generation and have different work and rest habits, we don't work or play together. Even so, we're all fond of shopping online and usually help each other receive packages if they or my family aren't home. Two things about my neighbor that always make me laugh and I feel interesting. The older woman frequently used a local dialect to yell at the man, who didn't do something better. The older man didn't give any response to the woman except to simply lower his head. The other is that the woman feeds a very pretty and cute cat, but she never allows the cat to run out of the house. If the cat does so, the voice of the woman calling the cat can be heard at a long distance. As a result, the cat is very timid and scary whenever I see it. 

Although the couple and my family don't do anything together, we would do the same things at some festivals, such as pasting red couplets at the Chinese Spring Festival, visiting our ancestor's graves at the Qingming festival, and so on. To maintain good relationships, we sometimes help each other in our daily lives.

Describe a time when someone asked for you opinion. Who asked for your opinion. Why he/she wanted to know your opinion. What opinion you gave. How you felt when she/he asked for your opinion.

Nowadays, we often ask for our friends' suggestions in our daily lives, such as which garment is most suitable before attending a party, how to choose a laptop, and so on. If I had to describe a time when someone came to me for my advice. I think that would be my aunt asking for my opinion before her son applies to the university. 

I received a call 3 years ago from my aunt, who asked me how to choose a major in college because her son would attend university soon. Because I graduated from university over 10 years ago and have worked for over 10 years. As a result, my aunt thought asking for my opinion on how to select a suitable major in college was more advisable. In my experience, I gave her two options: one was choosing computer-related majors, which have been proven to be more competitive after graduation in recent years. The other was choosing law-related majors, which would help her son prepare for the civil service examination after graduation. With the increase in employment pressure in recent years, more and more undergraduates, postgraduates, and even doctoral students are taking the civil service examination to become civil servants after completing their studies in college. Therefore, if her son wants to earn large amounts of money, computer-related majors are the most appropriate choice. Otherwise, law-related majors would be better. 

Although my aunt listened to my suggestions, she didn't make any decisions for her son. Maybe she already had a few ideas in her mind that she needed to discuss with her son. But from her perspective, I think she would advise her son to select a law-related major because being a civil servant would be more promising there days.

Describe a popular/well-known person in your country. Who this person is. What he/she has done. Why he/she is popular. How you feel about this person.

Many celebrities in my country are active on social media today. If I had to choose one of them to talk about. I think that would be Koo Tin Look, one of the most famous movie stars in my country.

His Chinese name is Koo Tin Lok, and his English name is Louis Koo. I have seen him many times on TV during my childhood. Unlike other celebrities who have retired after earning lots of money. He is over 50 and continues to play many key roles in movies. I followed his Sina Weibo several years ago and checked his latest status almost every week. A recent posting on his Weibo announced that the movie Warriors of Future will run next month. This film is his first science fiction film which has been produced for over 10 years. As seen in the trailer, he acted as a warrior fighting against aliens. The reason that he is very popular in my country and I respect him is that he invested large amounts of money earned from movies in Chinese education. Many schools named after him were built in poor Chinese areas. For the past 20 years, he has helped many poor kids to continue their studies. I often saw pictures of him and many poor children on social media. Viewing these pictures makes me feel pride and respect for him.

To support his career, I decided to watch every movie he is in. I'm looking forward to watching the movie Warriors of Future next month. Sincerely wish him a successful box office.

Describe something you do to keep fit and healthy. What it is. When you do it. Who you do it with. Why it is important to keep fit and healthy. Why it can help you keep fit and healthy. 

Nowadays, more and more people pay more attention to keeping fit and healthy, such as exercising in a gym, improving their diets, and so on. If I had to describe one thing I'm doing to stay in shape and be healthy. I think it would be a particular sport, High-Intensity Interval Training or HIIT, which combines running, jumping, and rest. I almost exercise every afternoon.

I have read many articles on the Internet that people with a sedentary lifestyle would be at higher risk of diabetes, obesity, and other diseases. This is harmful to me as a software engineer who has to sit in front of the computer for over 6 hours every day. Nevertheless, studies also indicated that if such people exercise for half an hour each day, the risk can be significantly reduced. To counteract the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle, I downloaded a suite of HIIT videos called T25 from the Internet. After that, I practiced according to the coach's instructions. This video has three advantages: first, it's very short and only lasts 25 minutes for each. Second, I don't need to exercise every day, 5 times per week is enough. Finally, the training effect is amazing. I can see my abs in front of a mirror after exercising for three months.

With the increased work pressure in modern society, more people are suffering from subhealthy conditions. How to keep fit and healthy is a challenge for everybody today. Thanks to this video, my physical body has improved a lot. I feel more energetic and healthier than before. I believe I will continue to exercise with this video until it becomes one of my habits.

Describe an invention that has changed the world in a positive way. What it is. What benefits it has brought. How it influences people of different ages. How it change people's lives.

With the development of technology, many products invented over the past 100 years have changed our world, such as the automobile, electricity, satellite, and so on. If I had to choose one of them that changed our world wholly, I think that would be the mobile phone. 

Writing letters was a common way for people to stay in touch with one another during the last century. However, people can now talk with their friends and families almost anywhere and anytime through their cell phones. Aside from the basic voice call provided by a smartphone, people can also use them for video calls, surfing the Internet, watching a live performance, and other meaningful events. As the technology of the Internet and correspondence has constantly developed over the past 10 years, access to the smartphone is not a big deal for people of any age today. As you can see, many students take advantage of their cell phones to attend remote education. Young adults can hold business meetings through cell phones, and even elderly adults can use them for consulting doctors about their illnesses. These features have altered people's lives a lot in recent years. I can't imagine how people would live without the use of a cell phone. 

Even though the cell phone brings many positive effects on people's lives, we also need to be aware of some other negative effects arising from the cell phone, like smartphone addiction, and the issue of eyestrain. As long as the cell phone is used appropriately, I believe the device can benefit people in more positive ways in the future.

Describe an item of clothing that someone gave you. What the clothing was. Who gave it to you. When you got it. Why this person gave you the clothing. 

If I had to describe a time when someone sent an item of clothing to me, I think it would be my classmate sending me a T-shirt last week. 

One of my elementary school classmates held a party last month since we didn't meet each other after graduation from elementary school. She purchased tailor-made T-shirts online and required us to wear these T-shirts during the party. Unfortunately, I missed this party due to some private matters. So my classmate said she could give the T-shirt to me at the next party. It seems that every classmate is very busy during the day and only has time to chat with each other after work. I almost forgot about this event until a few days ago. My classmate contacted me saying she was willing to send this T-shirt to me and asked where I lived. I said my home was located next to my hometown's central hospital and I would wait for her at the gate of the hospital. After 30 minutes, my classmate arrived at the hospital. Her look changed a lot when I first saw her. I hardly recognized her until she called my name. We had a brief talk about our lives in recent years. Then, she handed the T-shirt over to me before we parted. At the same time, she suggested not to miss the next party. And I gave her my promise.

I haven't seen my classmates for about 20 years. I recall many meaningful and interesting memories. I think whatever happens I will never miss the next party with my classmates.

Describe a way/change that helps you save a lot of time. What it is. How you implement it. How difficult it is. How you feel about the way/change.

Time is the most valuable thing in one's lifetime. If I had to describe a method that could improve my time use on a daily basis. I think that would be to create a timetable.

Unlike other material factors, like treasure, power, and status. All of us only have 24 hours each day, which means how to use these 24 hours effectively is a big deal for everybody today. In my opinion, the best way for me to spend time productively is to establish a timetable, writing everything I want to do onto this timetable during the day, especially executing a project at work or learning a new technique. At the beginning of my preparation for the IELTS examination, I found it quite difficult to organize and execute my study schedule, like what time is the most suitable for me to practice speaking and writing, or how to improve my schedule if the previous mission didn't finish on time. In spite of this, I continuously improved my timetable and gradually adapted to it after struggling for over 2 weeks. I can now finish every task on the table within a fixed time. Completing these tasks each day on the timetable makes me feel a sense of achievement.

My schedule was occasionally interrupted by some accidental events, but it wouldn't prevent me from completing my timetable. Thanks to this method, my learning efficiency has improved a lot. I think I will continue to execute my timetable until I accomplish my goal.

Describe something that you can't live without(not a computer/phone). What it is. What you do with it. How it helps you in your life. Why you can't live without it.

There are many necessities in our daily lives that people cannot live without, like water, clothes, accommodation, and so on. If I had to choose one of them that I would not be able to live without in my life, it would be electricity.

As modern society continuously develops, electricity is becoming one of the most significant things in people's lives, including my family. I use it to charge my smartphone, light up my house, and boil drinking water. It's also important for my country in industry, irrigation, and transportation. The vast majority of people living on Earth depend on it, which is also a high-tech symbol of human civilization. I cannot imagine how people would live without the use of electricity. Taking my family as an example, the vegetables and meat stored in my refrigerator would not stay fresh a few days later without electricity, and I may lose my job since I am a software engineer who relies on computers powered by electricity. It is because of electricity that I can enjoy various conveniences almost every second, which people living hundreds of years ago couldn't obtain. Therefore, it is no doubt that a large-scale power failure would result in a catastrophe in human society. 

With the rapid growth of the global population, the lack of electricity is affecting people who live in remote areas. However, many countries are striving to improve their infrastructure to address these issues. I believe people in every corner of the Earth will eventually use electricity in the future.

Describe an occasion that you lost something. What you lost. When and where you lost it. What you did to find it. How you felt about it.

I'm not a careless person in my daily life, and I rarely lose my personal belongings. The only exception is I lost my iPhone6 on the way to my workplace several years ago.

I was working in the capital of my country, Beijing, 6 years ago. That day was a bit cold, so I put on a jacket with my iPhone6 inside. I headed to my office by bus in the morning as usual. Because it was the morning peak for work, many people had already packed onto the bus I wanted to take. Therefore, I squeezed into the bus with lots of effort. All I remember is that I made an effort to approach the back door of the bus because I would have gotten off after 30 minutes. Finally, I reached the back door and got off the bus successfully. Unfortunately, I found out my iPhone6 was lost when I put my hands into my pocket. I was very nervous and tried to recall what happened on the bus but I remembered nothing. I calmed myself down and decided to call the police. After the police officer understood the whole event, he told me that the possibility of retrieving my phone was very low. I felt very sad. The only thing I can do was lock down my iPhone6 to prevent my personal privacy from leaking and report the loss of my SIM card to my service provider. 

This losing experience taught me to carefully preserve my belongings anywhere and anytime, especially in a place that is overcrowded. Although this event has passed for over 6 years, I still think of my iPhone6 occasionally.

Describe a movie you watched recently and would like to watch again. What type of movie it was. What is was about. Where you watched it. Why you would like to watch it again.

There are various types of movies running in my country lately, including comedy, action, and science fiction. If I had to choose one I want to watch again, it would be Warriors of Future, produced by Koo Tin Lok, one of my nation's most famous movie stars. 

This movie is his first science fiction film which has been produced for over 10 years. Last month I noticed a message on his Sina Weibo announcing that the movie would run in 2 weeks. Therefore, I decided to watch it on the premiere day. Luckily, there is a cinema about half a kilometer from my house. I bought a ticket and walked 5 minutes to get there to watch this movie. I was shocked by the visual effect of this movie after watching it. It is definitely the first science fiction film with the finest 3D special effects in the history of Chinese cinema. The plot of this movie was simple, the vast majority of people living on Earth 50 years later are suffering from harsh environmental conditions. However, a meteorite with extraterrestrial life lands on Earth which can help purify the polluted air. A war between humans and aliens breaks out. Humanity needs to limit the growth of alien creatures while preventing their extinction.

To be honest, the plot is easy to understand, but the purpose of watching this movie is not only to enjoy the visual effect but also to support the career of this celebrity because he invested large amounts of money in Chinese education. And I plan to watch this movie again with my friends next month. 


21th day:

Describe a time when you saw a lot of plastic waste(e.g. in a park, on the beach, etc.). Where and when you saw the plastic waste. Why there was a lot of plastic waste. What you did after you saw them. What your thoughts were about this.

Plastic products are indispensable daily necessities in our lives, such as plastic bags, plastic boxes, plastic toys, and so on. If I had to describe a time when I saw many plastic waste, it would a garbage station near my house I see it almost every day.

In my daily life, I was never aware of plastic waste is a big deal until I watched a documentary about plastic pollution. Then I noticed a garbage station about 100 meters from my house collects discarded products packed in disposable plastic bags, which eventually turn into plastic waste. Due to the density of resident is very high in my community, people dump their unusable stuff and plastic products into this place which needs to be dealt with every day. Therefore, I started to worry about how to tackle these kinds of plastic waste becuase most of them hardly degrade within 100 years according to latest research. As seen in the documentary I watched previously, the process in which plastic is extracted from fossil oil produces considerable carbon dioxide which is the culprit of global warming. In addition, scientists even found out microplastics in marine creatures' guts, which has arouse widespread concern in scientific circles. 

After watching this documentary, I realized that plastic waste is a vital problem for us. Although, I can do nothing about plastic waste in the garbage station near my house, the only thing I can do is to reduce the usage frequency of plastic, especially the plastic bag. Its better alternatives are paper and cotton bags.
