Today people live longer after retiring from work. What problems does this cause for individuals and society? What can be done?

The world is on the cusp of a sharp rise in the number of old people, and they can expect to live longer after retirement than ever before. This essay will discuss what consider to be the major challenges this brings and propose ways in which the consequences of a rise in the number of older citizens can be mitigated.

While the addition of a decade or more to our lives can be wonderful, there are inevitably challenges that will arise for the individual. One of these is the onset of debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer and diabetes. These diseases not only make it difficult to continue to enjoy a normal life but also weigh heavily on other members of the family, who may have to bear much of the burden of care financially and/or physically. Another issue is the financial strain the elderly themselves can be under. If, for instance, they retire at the age of 65 but live beyond 90, they may well find that their savings run out, and they become either destitute or reliant on state or family care.

Clearly, society as a whole is impacted as well. As an increasing proportion of a country's resources end up being dedicated to the care of the elderly, much-needed funds are taken away from other areas of society, such as schooling and security. In the UK, for example, the budget for aged care has risen by millions of pounds, though it is still not enough to provide adequate care for pensioners. Meanwhile, schools and law enforcement have had their budgets slashed to the detriment of education standards and public safety.

In order to adapt to this new reality, several steps can be taken. The most obvious one would be to increase the age of retirement. Rather than force people to give up work at 65, which could eventually place them in dire financial circumstances, healthy individuals should be encouraged to continue working longer. This would mean more taxes paid and less money flowing out into pensions, which could make government budgets in better shape. A second simple measure would be to prioritize preventative healthcare. In other words, rather than wait for aged people to develop illnesses, the government should subsidize exercise programs, nutrition classes, and even fund practitioners to conduct home visits in order to keep elderly people active members of society for longer.

In conclusion, although there are a number of health and economic implications that an increase in life expectancy can bring, governments can take active measures to lessen its negative impact. Increasing the retirement age and providing early health services are just two approaches the authorities can adopt to reduce the pressure on aging populations.
